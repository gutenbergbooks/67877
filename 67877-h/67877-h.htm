<p class="bigfont no-indent">How to Overthrow Plutocracy</p>

<p>Several million people in the United States are in substantial accord with the
demands of the People’s Party. A majority of all voters would welcome Government
Ownership of Railroads and other public utilities. The recent great victory in Chicago
for Municipal Ownership demonstrates this fact. What Chicago has done locally can
be accomplished in the nation—and WILL be done as soon as the people overcome</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">Political Inertia</p>

<p>With many the voting habit becomes fixed after one or two elections. The ordinary
man keeps on “voting ’er straight” long after he has discovered that his party’s actions
are out of joint with his own views. Party “regularity” commands the average man’s
support long after he KNOWS his party is headed wrong. Some really great men,
even, have placed party “regularity” before principle.</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">A Great Light</p>

<p>on the correct principle of organization is to be found in that admirable work by George
Gordon Hastings,</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">The First American King</p>

<p>A dashing romance, in which a scientist and a detective of today wake up seventy-five
years later to find His Majesty, Imperial and Royal, William I, Emperor of the
United States and King of the Empire State of New York, ruling the land, with the
real power in the hands of half a dozen huge trusts. Automobiles have been replaced
by phaërmobiles; air-ships sail above the surface of the earth; there has been a successful
war against Russia; a social revolution is brewing. The book is both an
enthralling romance and a serious sociological study, which scourges unmercifully the
society and politics of the present time, many of whose brightest stars reappear in the
future under thinly disguised names. There are wit and humor and sarcasm galore—a
stirring tale of adventure and a charming love story.</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">Hon. Thomas E. Watson says:</p>

<p>“I read ‘The First American King,’ and found it one of the most interesting books
I ever opened. Mr. Hastings has not only presented a profound study of our social
and economic conditions, but he has made the story one of fascination. It reminds me
at times of Bellamy’s ‘Looking Backward,’ but the story is told with so much more
human interest, the situations themselves are so much more dramatic, that it impresses
me very much more favorably than any book of that kind I have ever known.”</p>

<p>Interesting as the story is as a romance and as a critical sociological study, one of
its vitally important points is</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">How to Organize</p>

<p><b>Mr. Hastings says:</b></p>

<p>“It has been suggested,” continued General Mainwarren, “that a wise course for
patriotic leaders of your day would have been to have abandoned the hope of converting
and securing the grown voters as a body. It would have been best for them, at a
given time, to have said: ‘Beginning from today, we will pay no attention to any male
who is more than fifteen years of age and who is now, or within the next six years will
be, entitled to a vote. But we will direct all efforts to an entirely new body of
suffragists.’ They should then have turned their attention to the <i>women of the land</i>, to
the mothers of future generations of voters. It has been said that ‘Every woman is at
heart a royalist.’ It could with equal truth be said: ‘Every woman is by nature a
politician.’ ... Look at the influence exerted politically by various women of
whom history speaks.”</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">This Is the Key-Note of Success</p>

<p>For fifteen years the People’s Party, in season and out of season, has preached
“Equal Rights to All, Special Privileges to None.” It has persistently demanded that
government shall attend to public matters, and that private business shall be conducted
by individuals with the least possible interference—and absolutely no favoritism—by
government. It has continually demanded public ownership and government
operation of railroads and other public utilities. It has urged the initiative, referendum
and the recall; a scientific money system; the abolition of monopoly in every form.
Millions of voters—as the Chicago election clearly indicates—are in accord with the
People’s Party; but heretofore the voting habit, the “vote ’er straight” political
insanity, has kept them in political slavery.</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">Educate the Boys</p>

<p>Let us train up a new generation of voters—without diminishing our efforts to
break up old party habits—who will have the courage of conviction and correct ideas
regarding politics and economics. Let us interest the mothers, so we can have the
boys taught to cast their first votes on the side of Justice. Habit will then keep them
voting right.</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">Let Us Begin Now</p>

<p>Mr. Hastings’s book is a thought-provoker. It combines romance with sociology
and teaches while entertaining. With “The First American King” and TOM WATSON’S
MAGAZINE in another 100,000 homes, our first great step will be taken toward
overcoming plutocracy. With this end in view, we have made arrangements whereby
we can offer a dollar book, 350 pages, and a dollar magazine one year, 128 pages
monthly, both for only $1.50.</p>

<p class="bigfont no-indent">Tom Watson’s Magazine and
The First American King $1.50</p>

<p>In order to treat all alike, the book will be sent postpaid to any present subscriber
of TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE on receipt of 60 cents. No person not a subscriber
can buy “The First American King” of us for a cent less than $1.00. If you have not
already subscribed for the magazine, send us $1.50 today for this attractive combination,
and expedite the work of building up the People’s Party of the future.</p>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY THOMAS E. WATSON</p>

<h3><i>Our Creed</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE People’s Party does not attempt
the impossible, or seek
the unattainable.</p>

<p>Our young men do not dream
dreams; our old men do not see visions.
We are wedded to practical reforms
which have been tried in civilized communities,
and which have vindicated
themselves by results.</p>

<p>We do not propose to re-create society,
subvert law and order, confiscate
property, or substitute a new system
of government for the old.</p>

<p>We do not want to tear down the
house in order to repair it.</p>

<p>We do not hope to build a perfect
state with imperfect human hands,
but we do intend to make the government
as nearly perfect as possible, to
the end that it shall represent that conception
of justice which deals with all
men alike, and allows to every child of
Adam a fair chance in the world which
God created as a home for the human
race.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We believe that the government
should be clothed with all the attributes
of sovereignty; that <i>the government
should govern</i>, and should <i>not
delegate to private citizens or corporations</i>
any part of its sovereign power.</p>

<p>The creation of a national currency
has always been an attribute of sovereignty—of
royalty.</p>

<p>In a system where the people rule
the people succeed to the power of
the king; and that attribute of sovereignty
which the king exercised and
did not delegate should be exercised
by the people and should not be
delegated.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Populists, successors
to the old Greenbackers, have always
clung to it as an article of faith that
the Federal Government should exercise
its constitutional right to create
a currency, and should not delegate
that power to national banks or to
private citizens or corporations.</p>

<p>The government should supply the
country with a sufficient amount of
national money, every dollar of which
should be equal to any other; every
dollar of which should be a full legal
tender for all claims, public and private,
and <i>no dollar of which should be
made redeemable in any other dollar</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We believe that those things which
are essentially public in their nature
and their use should belong to the
public, and should be equally enjoyed
by all.</p>

<p>Just as the navigable rivers are public
to the beggar and the millionaire
alike, just as the Bay and the Gulf and
the Harbor and the navigable Lakes are
the common property of the rich and
the poor, the high and low, the black
and white, so we believe that the roads
should be common ground upon which
every citizen should be free to pass
upon terms of equality, and that the
iron highways of today, which were
taken from the people by the exercise
of the right of Eminent Domain, should
be restored to the public by the same
law of Eminent Domain, a fair compensation
having been paid, and the
property operated hereafter for the
benefit of all the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[Pg 386]</span></p>

<p>So with the Telegraph and the Telephone
and Express Companies.</p>

<p>In every city and town we believe
that the municipality, which is a part
of the state’s sovereignty, should take
over to itself those public utilities
which in their very nature are monopolies,
and, just compensation having
been paid, that these utilities should
be used for the benefit of the people,
to whom they belong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We believe that the government
should be supported by a system of
taxation in which each citizen will pay
taxes <i>in proportion to his ability to pay</i>.</p>

<p>We believe in a Tax on the Franchises
enjoyed by private corporations.</p>

<p>We believe that the Income Tax
would be the fairest of all taxes, because
it would take for the support of
the government, not the property of
the citizen, but a portion of the income
which the citizen derives from that
property, or from his individual exertions,
and the tax would be proportioned
to the income.</p>

<p>That property or that salary could
not be enjoyed without the protection
and the advantages which flow from
government, and it is eminently fair,
where the government has protected
me, or where it affords me such
opportunities, that I can receive a
large income from any source whatever,
I should pay to the government,
in return for its protection and its advantages,
a fair share of that which I
could not have made without that protection
and those advantages.</p>

<p>Under our present system a man
like John D. Rockefeller pays no more
Tariff tax when he buys a hat than a
doctor or lawyer or preacher pays when
he buys a hat. So with the shoes, the
clothes, the crockery on the table,
the furniture in the house. Many a
citizen whose income does not amount
to ten thousand dollars per year pays
fully as much Tariff tax in the purchasing
of necessary articles of clothing,
furniture and food as John D.
Rockefeller pays, whose income is
counted monthly by the millions of
dollars.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of Carnegie,
Morgan, Hill, Harriman, Gould, Cassatt,
Vanderbilt. Many a farmer whose
income from his farm may not do more
than give his family an actual support,
after the operating expenses are paid,
contributes annually a greater sum in
Tariff tax to the Federal Government
than is paid by the fabulously wealthy
beneficiaries of class legislation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been said that the People’s
Party dodges the Tariff issue. This
is not true.</p>

<p>One of our earliest platforms, which
has been repeatedly reindorsed, declares:</p>

<p>“<i>We demand the removal of the Tariff
tax from the necessaries of life which the
poor must have to live.</i>”</p>

<p>This is precisely the principle announced
by Thomas Jefferson, who declared
that the taxes should be so laid
that the luxuries of life would bear the
burden of government, and that his
ideal was a system in which the poor
would be entirely relieved from the
crushing weight of taxation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have said that legislation
should not be so framed as to
build up one business at the expense
of another.</p>

<p>If the People’s Party platform were
enacted into law, <i>there could be no
such thing as a Trust in the United
States</i>.</p>

<p>In order that the people should become
the victims of such tyranny as
that exercised by the Trusts two things
are necessary: <i>Foreign relief must be
made impossible, and domestic relief
made impracticable</i>.</p>

<p>The Tariff wall keeps the foreigner
from interfering; the railroads and
the national banks supporting the
Trusts make it impossible for domestic
dissatisfaction to assert itself effectively.</p>

<p><i>If the people should put upon the
free list those articles which are made
the subject of the Trusts, the foreigner
could at once invade the market, and
destroy the monopoly upon which the
Trust is based.</i></p>

<p>If the Populist principles of finance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[Pg 387]</span>
and of transportation should be carried
into effect, the Government abolishing
national banks and private ownership
of transportation lines, <i>the rebate would
be impossible, discriminations would
cease, equality would prevail, and there
would be no collusion between the national
banks and the railroads by which
Trusts are made invincible as they are
now invincible</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We believe in direct Legislation—putting
the power of making laws and
choosing rulers back into the hands of
those to whom it belongs—and the
election of all officers by the people.</p>

<p>The people should not be made to
await the pleasure of the Legislature
or of Congress. They should not be
kept in ignorance of what the law is
until legislative acts become known
through the newspapers. There should
be in every case the right to initiate
those laws which they want, and to
veto, through the Referendum, any
law which they do not like.</p>

<p>When an officer whom they have
elected shows by any vote or act that
he is not the man they took him to
be, they should not have to wait till
the expiration of his term to get a
better man. They should have the
right to recall the officer the moment
he betrays his trust.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We believe in the eight-hour day
for labor in Government works, in
factories, workshops and mines.</p>

<p>We believe in the regulation of
child labor in factories, workshops
and mines, to the end that children
of tender age shall not be made to
slave out their lives in order that
corporations shall have cheap labor
and large dividends.</p>

<p>Saturn, the old fable tells us, devoured
his own children: Christian
civilization does the same thing.</p>

<p>As long as we permit children of
ten and twelve years to labor from
eight to fourteen hours per day in our
mills and workshops modern civilization
is another Saturn. <i>We are devouring
our own children.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We believe that the land, the common
heritage of all the people, should
not be monopolized for speculative
purposes, or by alien ownership, but
that legislation should be so shaped
as to encourage to its full extent
the right of every man born into this
world to till the soil and make a living
out of it.</p>

<p>And one of the principal reasons
why we favor a graduated income
tax, which increases by geometrical
progression as the income increases,
is that it automatically keeps the
wealth of the country in a constant
sort of redistribution, and acts as a
check upon that excessive accumulation
which is recognized by all intelligent
thinkers as one of the most
serious perils and intolerable evils
of our present era of class legislation.</p>

<p>These are the most important articles
of our faith. It is for these principles
that we have struggled ever since
1891—with never a doubt that they
were sound, that they would constantly
gain converts, <i>that they would ultimately
win</i>.</p>

<p>When I founded the <i>People’s Party
Paper</i> in Atlanta, Ga., in 1891 (which
paper lived and toiled for these principles
until the fusion movement of
1896 killed it, as it killed twelve hundred
other Populist papers), I announced
the same purpose which I
announced in the prospectus of this
magazine.</p>

<p>My faith was as firm in 1891 as it
is today, and I had as little doubt
then as I have now that Populism is
just as sure to triumph as the sun
is to continue to warm the world.</p>

<p>The reforms will be effected <i>because
the country needs them</i>. It cannot
stand much more of the present
system. It will not accept Socialism.
Occupying the middle ground of radical,
but practical reform, Populism is
inevitable.</p>

<h3><i>National Politics and Policies</i></h3>

<p>There is a saying that the difference
between a wise man and a fool is that
the wise man never makes the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[Pg 388]</span>
mistake twice, while the fool continues
to make it without limit.</p>

<p>It is of supreme importance that
those who will act as political leaders
during the next four years should think
clearly in order that they may act
wisely.</p>

<p>We have not, as yet, discovered any
brighter lamp with which to guide our
footsteps than that which Patrick
Henry named the Lamp of Experience.</p>

<p>If I felt that our national leaders
were about to repeat a disastrous mistake
and adopt a policy which seems
the continuance of the reign of class
legislation and special privilege, I
should be false to my own sense of duty
if I did not at this early day point out
that error and warn the Jeffersonians
against it.</p>

<p>I say Jeffersonians because, after all
is said and done, there are but two
great differences of political thought
in the United States—never have been
but two; never will be but two.</p>

<p>On the one hand are those who believe
that legislation should be dictated
by the interest of the few; that
the powers and the benefits of good
government should be monopolized by
the few; that the blessings and the
opportunities of life should be the heritage
of the few; that wealth and privilege
and national initiative should perpetually
be the legacy of the few.</p>

<p>On the other hand is the Jeffersonian
idea that the human family are all alike
the children of God; that the earth and
all it contains was created for the benefit
of this human family, and that any
system of law and government which
gathers into the hands of the few an
unjust proportion of the common estate,
to the exclusion of the vast majority,
is an infamous invasion of the
natural rights of man.</p>

<p>Now, what is it that endangers the
cause of the Jeffersonians?</p>

<p>What is it that seems to me to be
so certain to insure the continuance of
the rule of the few over the many?</p>

<p>It is the continued existence of the
political alignment of the great mass
of the people in two political parties,
each of which, in its heart of hearts,
is wedded to the rule of the few.</p>

<p>Neither one of these parties wants
any material change in our present system
of legislation or of administration.</p>

<p>Both of them are absolutely dominated
by the same interests.</p>

<p>In the ranks of each of these parties
are found the powerful railroad kings,
the irresistible trusts, the indispensable
national banks, the vastly influential
insurance companies.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, nearly every
board of management of every predatory
corporation against which the
people are rising in revolt is made up
half and half of Democrats and Republicans,
in order that, no matter
which party wins at the polls, the corporation
will have influence at court.</p>

<p>It is so clear to me that the only
possible hope for the people is to drive
these two parties together while the
people unite under another standard.</p>

<p>In vain does Judge Parker talk about
the difference between his Democracy
and the Republicanism of Mr. Roosevelt.
During the campaign he was unable
to state any difference, and there
is, in fact, no difference.</p>

<p>Between Belmont’s ideas of government
and those of Mark Hanna there
is not the slightest difference.</p>

<p>Between the Democratic corporation
and the Republican corporation it is
absurd to claim that there is any difference.</p>

<p>Between Democratic manufacturers
and Republican manufacturers no human
being of intelligence will expect
any difference or find any.</p>

<p>In other words, the millionaire beneficiaries
of class legislation control both
of the old parties, and the battle which
they wage year after year, decade after
decade, is a mere sham battle. The
strategy of the corporations consists in
keeping the people divided in order
that the corporations may rule.</p>

<p>Believing this to be true, I am painfully
impressed with the fact that Mr.
Bryan is making a huge mistake.</p>

<p>The pity of it is, he has already made
that mistake twice, and is now making
it for the third time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[Pg 389]</span></p>

<p>What is the mistake?</p>

<p>It consists of the effort to get radical
reform out of a party which has
always been dominated and always
will be dominated by conservatives.
When the currency was contracted
just after the Civil War and ruin
brought upon so many thousands of
people in this country, it took the joint
action of both the old parties to do it.</p>

<p>When the revenue taxes were taken
off railroads, manufactures, insurance
companies, bank checks and express
companies, soon after the close of the
Civil War, it took the joint action of
both the old parties to do it.</p>

<p>When the Income Tax was lifted
from the burdened shoulders of the
rich, it took the joint action of both
the old parties to do it.</p>

<p>When Silver was struck down and
the Gold Standard forced upon us, it
took the joint action of both the old
parties to do it.</p>

<p>When our National Bank System
was enthroned, and that terribly unjust
system was chartered to prey
upon the people, it required the joint
action of both the old parties to do it.</p>

<p>When Congress, over the protest of
Thaddeus Stevens and others, obeyed
the command of the Rothschilds (delivered
at Washington personally by
August Belmont, the father of the
present Boss of the Democratic Party),
and declared by legislative enactment
that the banks should be paid in gold
while the soldier at the front should
be paid in greenbacks, it required the
joint action of both the old parties to
do it.</p>

<p>There has never been a necessary act
of Congress—necessary to the rule of
the few, necessary to carry out the
Hamiltonian ideal—that did not rest
for support one foot on the Republican
Party and the other on the Democratic
Party.</p>

<p>The man who does not know this to
be true is unfamiliar with official
records.</p>

<p>The time has been when Mr. Bryan
held the same opinions which I am
expressing now. The time has been
when he declared, in speech and writing,
that there was no hope for reform
in the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>In 1896 Mr. Bryan, in the Omaha
<i>World-Herald</i>, editorially asked:</p>

<p>“<i>Can a National Convention harmonize
the discordant elements of the
Democratic Party? Impossible.</i></p>

<p>“Suppose the advocates of bimetallism
control the National Convention
and nominate a Free Silver Democrat
upon a free coinage platform, will
Cleveland, Carlisle, Olney, Morton,
<i>et al.</i> support the ticket? Of course
not. They say that the free coinage
of silver means individual dishonesty,
commercial disaster and national dishonor,
and if they believe what they say
they ought not to support the ticket,
because their duty to their country
is higher than their duty to their party
organization. If, on the other hand,
the convention nominates a Gold
Standard Democrat on a platform indorsing
the gold standard, gold bonds
and national bank currency, should
the nominee be supported by those
who believe the gold standard to be a
conspiracy of the capitalistic classes
against the producers of wealth—a
crime against mankind? Who says
they should?</p>

<p>“If to continue Mr. Cleveland’s financial
policy is to declare war against
the common people, what friend of the
common people would be willing to
enlist in such a warfare, even at the
command of his party?</p>

<p>“The Democratic Party cannot serve
God and Mammon; it cannot serve plutocracy
and at the same time defend
the rights of the masses.</p>

<p>“If it yields to the plutocracy it ought
to lose, and it will lose, the support of
the masses; if it espouses the cause of
the people, it cannot expect either
votes or contributions from the capitalistic
classes and from the great corporations.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of this very correct
line of reasoning, Mr. Bryan resolutely
declared that if the Democratic Party
adopted the gold standard, “<i>I promise
you that I will go out and serve my country
and my God under some other name,
even if I must go alone.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[Pg 390]</span></p>

<p>Again Mr. Bryan said, in his book
called “The First Battle,” Chapter III,
page 124, “In that speech I took the
position which I have announced since
on several occasions, namely, that I
would not support for the Presidency
an advocate of the gold standard.”</p>

<p>Again Mr. Bryan said: “Does the
individual member of a party at all
times reserve the right to vote against
the nominee of a party, and to abandon
his party entirely whenever in his
judgment his duty to his country requires
it? He may abandon the party
temporarily, as, for instance, when an
unfit candidate is nominated, or the
voter may abandon his party permanently,
either when he himself
changes his opinion upon a paramount
public question or when his party
changes its position.”</p>

<p>Now let the reader compare the
present attitude of Mr. Bryan with
the political ethics expounded by him
in his book.</p>

<p>He was then the idol of the radicals;
he was then the Tribune of the People.</p>

<p>He was the strong and stalwart foe
of every plutocrat, every Wall Street
interest, every beneficiary of class
legislation.</p>

<p>The people hailed him with an enthusiasm
which had not been known
since the days of Henry Clay. So
great was their faith in him that he
swept into his movement in 1896 the
Free Silver organization and the great
bulk of the Populist Party.</p>

<p>Who is it that cannot see how
loftily he held his flag in those days?
Who is it that does not realize how
sadly it droops today?</p>

<p>From the noble stand of 1893 and
1896, what a falling off is there!
Boldly he declared that he would
never support for the Presidency an
advocate of the gold standard. Yet,
when Judge Parker slapped his face in
public with the Gold Telegram of
1904, the dauntless Bryan turned the
other cheek, like a very meek Christian
indeed.</p>

<p>He had said that a Democrat might
bolt his party <i>temporarily</i> upon the
nomination of an unfit candidate; he
had said that Judge Parker was an
unfit candidate, but he did not bolt
the nomination, even <i>temporarily</i>.</p>

<p>He had said that the voter might
abandon his party <i>permanently</i> when
that party changed its position upon a
paramount public question; yet when
the Democratic Party, with extraordinary
suddenness, changed its position
upon more than one paramount question
in 1904, Mr. Bryan did not bolt
his party <i>permanently</i>.</p>

<p>He had said that if the Democrats
took up the Republican financial
policy, which meant the slavery of
the debtors of this country and the
impoverishment of the people, he
would go out and serve his country
and his God under some other name,
even if he had to go alone. Yet when
his party did come over to the Republican
financial policy, and came by
telegraph at that, <i>Mr. Bryan did not
go out to serve either his country or his
God under some other name</i>.</p>

<p>He had said to his brother Democrats:
“If you are ready to go down
on your knees and apologize for what
you have said” (abuse of the Republicans
and the gold standard), “you will
go without me.”</p>

<p>Yet when the Democratic Party, at
the St. Louis Convention in 1904, went
down on its knees, in effect, to apologize
for the abuse which they had
heaped upon the Republicans for eight
years, they did not go without Mr.
Bryan. The knees of Mr. Bryan hit
the floor in timely cadence with the
knees of all the others, and when he
filed out of the convention hall the
dust was there to show it just as it
was there to show it on the knees of
all the others.</p>

<p>Bryan himself asked the question in
1896: “Can a National Convention harmonize
the discordant elements of the
Democratic Party?” He answered his
own question in the comprehensive
word, “<i>Impossible</i>.”</p>

<p>The event of the campaign of 1896
showed that he was right, for the
Cleveland-Carlisle-Belmont element
knifed him.</p>

<p>In the campaign of 1900 they knifed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[Pg 391]</span>
him again. In the campaign of 1904,
when the convention nominated a
gold standard Democrat on a platform
indorsing the gold standard, gold
bonds and the gold bank currency, the
people refused to support the sell-out
of the National Democratic Party to
Wall Street, just as Mr. Bryan, in
1896, prophesied that they would, in
spite of the fact that the prophet of
1896 had become the gold standard
nominee’s most earnest advocate in
the campaign of 1904.</p>

<p>In other words, the people had become
so inoculated with the true
gospel of Bryan, the Tribune of 1893
and 1896, that they refused to follow
the change of heart and the change of
conduct which came over Bryan, the
Parkerite of 1904.</p>

<p>Will not Mr. Bryan reflect upon this
and draw a lesson from it? He himself
has declared that he is attempting
the impossible in trying to harmonize
the discordant elements of the Democratic
Party.</p>

<p>What is the real statesmanship demanded
at this time?</p>

<p>That those who believe in Jeffersonian
ideals, whether they are now in
the Republican, Democratic, Populist
or Socialist parties, should come together
without prejudice for party
names, and should unite in the common
cause of driving from power the
beneficiaries of class legislation, no
matter whether those beneficiaries are
called Democrats or Republicans.</p>

<p>Let the Belmonts and Morgans get
together in the same party so that we
can fight them both at the same time.</p>

<p>As long as we cling to party differences
and party names our efforts will
come to naught, as they did in 1896,
1900 and 1904.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryan wants the reform movement
to stop and wait for him, while
for four years he struggles to get the
better of the plutocratic element of his
own party. If they were able to
wrest control from him when he had
so much more advantage than he has
now, how can we expect him to take
that control from their strong hands?</p>

<p>But, suppose he does succeed in defeating
the Belmont-Cleveland element
in the convention of 1908, does he not
know that they will fulfil his prediction
again and knife him as they have
done twice already?</p>

<p>On the other hand, suppose they
conquer him in 1908 as they did in
1904, will he not submit tamely to kiss
the hand that smote him as he did in
the last convention? Most assuredly
he will.</p>

<p>He lost his opportunity to fly the
flag of revolt when he failed to resent
the Gold Telegram of 1904. That opportunity
passed, never to return.</p>

<p>Absolutely the only hope of radical
reform lies in a straight-out, aggressive
and fearless <i>fight upon both the old
parties</i>, which in turn have had control
of the Government, and which have
played into each other’s hands in
forging the chains of class legislation
which now bind and burden the Common
People.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><i>Is It Paul Jones’s Body?</i></h3>

<p>Have they found the body of John
Paul Jones?</p>

<p>The experts say that they have.</p>

<p>To the legal mind, the fact that
<i>experts</i> had to be called in to pass upon
the question of identity is sufficient
to arouse suspicion and provoke investigation.</p>

<p>As stated in a former number, I was
certain they would find Paul Jones—in
their minds—for that was what they
were looking for.</p>

<p>Whenever, for instance, the medical
expert starts out to find arsenic in
the human stomach, arsenic generally
shows up all right enough.</p>

<p>In like manner French experts were
called in to identify a certain corpse
as that of Paul Jones, and, after the
most elaborate and beautifully regular
formalities, they solemnly pronounced
the verdict which they knew was expected
and which they were predisposed
to find.</p>

<p>“This is Paul Jones, isn’t it?” asks
General Porter, most suavely, not to
say persuasively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[Pg 392]</span></p>

<p>How could the politest experts of the
politest people on earth say nay?</p>

<p>The case was pitiful.</p>

<p>The search for Paul Jones’s body
had reached a crisis. Only four leaden
coffins had been found in the old graveyard,
and one of these <i>had</i> to be Paul
Jones, because he had been buried in
such a coffin, and the other three bore
name-plates which showed they could
not be his.</p>

<p>The fourth bore no name-plate;
therefore it <i>must</i> be Jones’s coffin.</p>

<p>The necessity of the situation required
it.</p>

<p>Consequently, polite French experts
measure, compare, incubate, decide and
bring in the verdict desired.</p>

<p>Looking at the matter as a lawyer,
I should say that there is not sufficient
legal evidence offered, as yet, to establish
the identity of the dead body.</p>

<p>The cemetery in which Commodore
Paul Jones was buried was closed by
law in 1793.</p>

<p><i>A canal was afterward cut through it.</i></p>

<p>The great sea-fighter was buried, as
Napoleon was, in uniform.</p>

<p>In the Life of him—“Great Commanders’
Series”—by Cyrus Townsend
Brady, the statement is made that <i>Paul
Jones was buried in the American uniform</i>,
and that <i>a sword and other articles
were placed in the coffin</i>.</p>

<p>The body which General Porter has
found was <i>not</i> clad in uniform.</p>

<p>There was no sword, or other article,
found in the coffin.</p>

<p>Commodore Jones died of dropsy,
which had swollen his body to such an
extent that he could not button his
waistcoat.</p>

<p>Yet the French experts declare that
all the measurements tally exactly with
those of the living Jones.</p>

<p class="f120"><i>Should They Do So?</i></p>

<p>Awful changes take place after death,
and they are greater with some than
with others.</p>

<p>Should the measurements of a corpse
which had been entombed more than a
hundred years correspond <i>exactly</i> with
those of the same body when alive?</p>

<p>Most biographers put the <i>height</i> of
Admiral Jones at “about five feet and
eight inches.”</p>

<p>Won’t you find a greater number
of men—in France especially—whose
height is “about five feet eight inches”
than you’ll find at any other figure?</p>

<p>And will you not find more <i>corpses</i>
of about that length?</p>

<p>Yet in these measurements consists
the whole of the testimony which has
been offered to the American people
to convince them that the body of
Paul Jones is at last to come home.</p>

<p>Unless the matter of the uniform
and the sword be cleared up, it is impossible
to accept the conclusion arrived
at by the experts.</p>

<p>This corpse may be, as already
stated, a good enough Jones for that
$35,000, but it has not yet been shown
to be John Paul Jones, the naval hero
of our War of Independence.</p>

<h3><i>Is the Black Man Superior to the White?</i></h3>

<p>With statistics one can prove many
things—the conclusion arrived at depending,
in all cases, considerably upon
the man behind the figures.</p>

<p>This time the man behind the figures
is Doctor Booker Washington—may
his shadow never grow less!</p>

<p>In the course of a recent lecture, the
learned Doctor laid down the proposition
that the black man is superior to
the white, and he proved it—proved it
by statistics.</p>

<p>He said that there is 85 per cent.
of illiteracy among the Spaniards,
while there is only 54 per cent. of illiteracy
among the negroes; therefore
the negroes are clearly more advanced
in civilization than the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Poor old Spain!</p>

<p>The learned Doctor further demonstrated
that there is 65 per cent. of
illiteracy among the Italians; therefore
the negroes are far ahead of Italy.
Russian illiteracy being 70 per cent.
the black man takes precedence of
the land of Peter the Great, Skobelef,
Gorky, Turgenef and Tolstoy. South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[Pg 393]</span>
America, having an illiteracy of 80
per cent., falls far to the rear of the
negro—and Castro must add this additional
kick to the many he has already
received from North America.</p>

<p>Proud of his statistics, Doctor Booker
Washington exclaims: “<i>The negro
race has developed more rapidly in the
thirty years of its freedom than the
Latin race has in one thousand years
of freedom.</i>”</p>

<p>That’s a bold statement, Doctor.</p>

<p>To say nothing of its accuracy, may
it not have been an unwise thing for
you to claim that the black man has
risen during thirty years more rapidly
in the scale of civilization than the
whites have risen in a thousand?</p>

<p>True, you confine yourself to the
Italians, the Spaniards, the Russians
and the South Americans, but when
you say the darkest of all the colored
races is superior to that great section
of the white race named by you, does
it not occur to you that you may
create a feeling of resentment among
<i>all</i> the whites?</p>

<p>You have thousands of true friends
throughout the entire country—white
men who have most generously helped
you in your work, helped you with
money, with moral support and with
a certain amount of social recognition.
Your admirers refer to you as a great
man. They allude to your work as a
great work. The South helps you
with appropriations, just as the North
helps you with donations. We want
to see you succeed in building up your
race.</p>

<p>But have you a single white friend
who will indorse your statement that
the black race is so superior to the
whites that it can do in one generation
what it required the whites a thousand
years to do?</p>

<p>Do you imagine that your friends,
President Roosevelt, Mr. Carnegie,
Dr. Hart, Bishop Potter, and others,
will like you better when they hear
you putting forth a claim to race
superiority? Doctor, you have overshot
the mark.</p>

<p><i>Whenever the North wakes up to the
fact that you are teaching the blacks that
they are superior to the whites, you are
going to feel the east wind.</i></p>

<p>What do you mean by racial development,
Doctor?</p>

<p>Apparently your standard of measurement
is illiteracy. That is to
say, if a greater number of negroes
than of Spaniards can read, then the
negro has achieved a higher plane
in civilization.</p>

<p>Is that your idea? Does the ability
to read constitute race development?</p>

<p>According to that, a million negro
children attend school twelve months
and become “civilized” because they
have learned to spell “Baker” and to
read “Mary had a little lamb.”</p>

<p>Does it not strike you, Doctor, that
such a measure might be delusive?</p>

<p>In making up your tables of illiteracy,
why didn’t you include <i>all the
negroes</i>, as you included <i>all</i> the Italians,
<i>all</i> the Spaniards, <i>all</i> the Russians?</p>

<p>Why leave out your home folks in
Africa, Doctor?</p>

<p>Why omit Santo Domingo and
Haiti?</p>

<p>If you will number <i>all</i> the negroes,
Doctor, your percentage of illiteracy
<i>among the blacks</i> may run up among the
nineties, and knock your calculation
into a cocked hat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the West Indies God poured His
blessings with lavish hand upon the
island of Haiti. The French went
there and built up a civilization. The
Revolution of 1789 freed the negroes
who were held in slavery by the whites,
and civil war soon followed.</p>

<p>The blacks outnumbered the whites
and the climate was their ally. Yellow
fever did for them what frost did
for the Russians when Napoleon struck
at their liberties. They achieved
freedom, and they have had it, not for
thirty years, but for a hundred years.</p>

<p><i>What have your people done with their
freedom in Santo Domingo, Doctor?</i>
Back, back into barbarism, voodooism,
human sacrifice, social and political
anarchy they have plunged; and their
history is one long blood-stained record
of backsliding from the standard which
the French had already established.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[Pg 394]</span>
Even now your black brethren in Santo
Domingo are beseeching the white
man of the United States to do that
which they are unable to do—administer
national affairs. In self-defense
this Government may have to treat
Santo Domingo as Great Britain treats
Jamaica, both governments acting
upon the demonstrated fact that the
blacks, <i>left to themselves</i>, are incapable
of self-government and race development.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But before entering into a comparison
of racial progress, Doctor, it is in
order to note the fact that you accredit
the negro with only thirty years of freedom.
Why, Doctor, <i>the negro race, as
a race, has enjoyed just as long a
period of freedom as the Celts, the Latins,
the Anglo-Saxons and the Slavs</i>.</p>

<p>The black race in Africa was as free
as the Indian race in North America.</p>

<p>During the thousand years in which
the whites were painfully creating the
civilization which <i>you</i> now enjoy,
<i>your</i> race, in its native home, was doing
pretty much the same things which
the red race was doing in North America.
Your people were running about
in the woods, naked, eating raw meat,
eternally at war—tribe with tribe—steeped
in ignorance, vice and superstition,
with an occasional lapse into
human sacrifice and cannibalism.</p>

<p><i>Your race, as a race, is free now in
Africa, as it has been since the dawn of
history:—where is the civilization which
it worked out for itself?</i> It does not
exist; it never did exist.</p>

<p>The negro has been absolutely unable
to develop as a race when left to
himself. Nowhere, at any time, has
he developed a system of agriculture,
or commerce, or manufactures, made
headway in mining or engineering, or
conceived a system of finance. Never
has he produced a system of laws, institutions
of state, religious organization,
or worked out a political ideal.
Never has he created a literature, or
developed original capacity for the fine
arts. His foot has never even crossed
the threshold of the world of creative
painting, sculpture, music, architecture
Into the realms of science, in the domain
of original thought, in the higher reaches
of mental power where the human
mind grapples with vast problems,
material and spiritual, the problems
of time and eternity, the negro has
never entered. No word has ever
fallen from his lips that was not the
echo of what some white man had already
said. He has sometimes <i>put his
foot in the white man’s track</i>, but that is
the best he has ever done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Compare this imitative race with the
great Latin stock—a stock from which
sprang Rienzi and Garibaldi, Cavour
and Napoleon, Da Vinci and Galileo,
Savonarola and Leo the Tenth, Titian
and Bellini, Raphael and Michelangelo.</p>

<p>The Latin race, whether in Spain,
Italy or South America, has developed
systems of agriculture, finance, commerce,
manufactures, education, religion,
government—has created literature,
laws and institutions of state,
has evidenced capacity in science and
art.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The negroes superior to the Latins?</p>

<p>Heavens above!</p>

<p>During the thousand years which
Doctor Washington says that the Latins
have done less than the negroes have
done in thirty, Spain rose into world-power,
dominated the European Continent,
shook England’s throne to its
base, broke the Turkish scimiter in
the great sea-fight of Lepanto, evolved
a splendid literature, reached the highest
development in the Fine Arts,
launched Columbus upon his voyage
into unknown seas to test the suggestion
of another Latin—Toscanelli—and
thus took the first daring step in
that marvelous chapter of Discovery
whose sober facts are grander and
stranger than Romance.</p>

<p>Has the learned Doctor ever studied
the history of Mexico—the Latin country
south of us?</p>

<p>Since a foreign yoke was thrown off
and Mexico “found herself,” what
country has made nobler progress?</p>

<p>The negro in Santo Domingo has had
a hundred years of freedom; Mexico<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[Pg 395]</span>
scarce half so many; <i>yet compare the
Mexico of today with the Santo Domingo
of today.</i> Left to themselves, the
Latins of Mexico have built up a magnificent
civilization.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, the negroes of
Santo Domingo have destroyed what
the French had already built.</p>

<p><i>In Mexico conditions get better, year
after year.</i></p>

<p><i>In Santo Domingo conditions grow
worse, year after year.</i></p>

<p>If the learned Doctor wants to make
a study in contrasts, let him first read
“Where Black Rules White,” by
Hesketh Prichard, and then read “The
Awakening of a Nation,” by Charles
F. Lummis, and I venture to say that
some of his cocky self-complacency as
to the superiority of the negroes over
the whites will ooze out of him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As to Italy—can it be that Italy has
done less in a thousand years than the
negroes have done in thirty?</p>

<p>The greatest man that ever lived was
of Italian extraction. Taine says that
Napoleon was a true Italian in character
and intellect. If that be true, then
<i>the two greatest men the world ever saw</i>
were Latins. Wherever the civilized
man lives today his environment, his
thoughts, his ideals, his achievements
are more or less influenced by the life
and work of Cæsar and Napoleon.</p>

<p>If any two men may be said to have
created the material modern world
those two Latins did it.</p>

<p>If modern Europe is any one man, it
is Napoleon. His laws, schools—social,
political, financial, educational institutions—have
wrung from rulers ever
since the homage of imitation.</p>

<p>In literature how illustrious is Italy?</p>

<p>It was Petrarch who was “the Columbus
of a new spiritual atmosphere,
the discoverer of modern culture.”</p>

<p>It was he who broke away from
monkish medievalism, created the
humanistic impulse, treated “man as a
rational being apart from theological
determination,” modernizing literature.</p>

<p>The “short story” writers of fiction—Edgar
Poe, Guy de Maupassant and
Kipling—had their teacher in Boccaccio
and his <i>novella</i>.</p>

<p>Modern history traces its methods,
its spirit and its form to Villani, Guicciardini,
and that wonderful type of Latin
genius, Machiavelli.</p>

<p><i>The whole world goes to school to the
Latins!</i></p>

<p>No painter hopes to excel Correggio,
Paul Veronese, Antonio Allegro, Tintoretto,
Velasquez, Murillo. No sculptor
expects to eclipse Niccola Pisano,
Orvieto, Orcagna or Luca della Robbia.</p>

<p>No worker in gold, silver and bronze
believes he can surpass Ghiberti, Cellini
and Donatello.</p>

<p>Architects the world over despair of
rivaling Alberti, Bramante, Giulo
Romano, Palladio.</p>

<p>These masters were masters to their
own generation, four and five hundred
years ago; they have been masters ever
since; they are masters still.</p>

<p>Wherever civilization extends its
frontiers these deathless Latins are in
the van—teaching what Truth and
Beauty are, refining the thoughts, elevating
the ideals, improving the methods,
inspiring the efforts of man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The negroes have done more than this,
and in thirty years?</i></p>

<p>You had forgotten the Renaissance,
hadn’t you, Doctor?</p>

<p>Asia was decaying, Africa was in its
normal state of savagery, Europe lay
torpid under the weight of ignorance
and superstition. Where learning existed
at all its spirit was dull, its form
heavy, its progress fettered by ancient
canons and cumbrous vestments.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Angel of Light—her
face a radiance, her presence an inspiration—puts
a silver trumpet to her
lips and blows, blows, till all the world
of white men hears the thrilling notes.</p>

<p>And lo! there is a resurrection!
What was best in the learning of the
past becomes young again, and ministers
to the minds of men.</p>

<p>Literature springs to life, throws off
antiquated dress, and takes its graceful
modern form. The fine arts flourish as
never before; the canvas, the marble,
the precious metal, feel the subtle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[Pg 396]</span>
touch of the eager artist, and give
birth to beauty which is immortal.
The heavy prison-castle of the Frank,
the Goth, the Norman, the Anglo-Saxon,
retires abashed before the elegant,
airy, poetic palace of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Nor does the revival of learning
limit itself to literature, architecture,
painting, sculpture. It extends to
law, to commerce, to agriculture, to
religion, to education.</p>

<p>Whence came the Renaissance, Doctor
Washington? Whence came that
mighty revival of intellectual splendor
which still influences the world? From
the Latin race, which you affect to
despise. From these Italians whom
you say are so inferior in development
to the negro.</p>

<p>Italy led the modern world in almost
everything which we call civilization—she
is today one of the world’s
most inspiring teachers, nor will her
power for good be gone till the Christian
religion is repudiated, the voice
of music hushed, the wand of literature
broken, the force of law defied,
the witchery of art lost to the minds,
the hearts and the souls of men.</p>

<p>And yet Doctor Washington asserts,
to one audience after another, that
those glorious achievements of the
Latins, the Italians, these imperishable
and ever potent achievements of a
thousand years, are exceeded by what
the negroes have done in thirty years!</p>

<p>From the Latin England took her religious
organization, as Germany and
Austria and France had done. Through
the Latin the classic literature of
Greece and earlier Rome came into the
modern world—an eternal debt which
we owe mainly to Petrarch.</p>

<p>The Bourbon kings imported from
Italy the architects, painters, sculptors,
landscape gardeners, who laid
upon uncouth feudal France the rich
mantle of Italian beauty.</p>

<p>It was the Latin who taught modern
Europe how to farm, how to irrigate,
how to engrave, how to make paper
from rags, how to bridge the rivers,
how to pave the streets, how to make
canals.</p>

<p>Some of Shakespeare’s plays are elaborations
and dramatizations of Italian
<i>novellas</i>. Chaucer, the father of English
poetry, frankly copied from the
Italian model.</p>

<p>Milton had Dante for pioneer, Spenser
had Ariosto, and Byron’s best work
is in the Italian form.</p>

<p>I presume, Doctor, that at this season
of the year you are copying the
style of the white man, and that you
are wearing a straw hat.</p>

<p>Well, the Latins taught us how to
make straw hats.</p>

<p>I presume that you recognize the
value of <i>glass</i>—one of whose hundreds
of uses is to show you how you look.</p>

<p>Well, the Latin taught us how to
make glass.</p>

<p>I presume you realize how much the
modern world, during the last thousand
years, has been indebted to the
modern ship.</p>

<p>Well, the Latin taught the Anglo-Saxon
how to build modern ships.</p>

<p>I presume you appreciate good rice,
Doctor.</p>

<p>Well, the seed of the heavy upland
rice which we have in this country was
brought out of Italy in the pockets of
Thomas Jefferson—gentleman-smuggler
in that instance.</p>

<p>I presume you will wear pink silk
undergarments this season as usual,
won’t you, Doctor?</p>

<p>Well, the Latin taught modern Europe
how to make and use silk.</p>

<p>And remember that the Latin took
the clumsy musical instruments of the
ancient world and fashioned them into
the perfect forms of the present time;
and that the Italians, whom you despise,
had created the violin while your
race was “rattling the bones” and
gradually climbing toward the “cakewalk.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What has the negro in these United
States been doing for the last thirty
years, Doctor?</p>

<p><i>Copying the white man.</i> That’s all.</p>

<p>He has simply been imitating, as
best he could, the dress, the talk, the
manners, the methods, the work of
the whites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[Pg 397]</span></p>

<p>The Latin whites <i>originated</i> a civilization;
the negroes are <i>copying</i> one.
Is there no difference between the
higher genius which conceives and the
lower talent which copies?</p>

<p>It required the genius of Raphael to
conceive and paint “The Transfiguration.”
Any ordinary artist can
make a fair copy of it. But does anyone
compare the copyist with the
original artist? It required the genius
of Sangallo and Michelangelo to rear
St. Peter’s at Rome: any well-educated
architect of today might rear
its duplicate. But would that make
the modern architect equal to the two
Italian masters?</p>

<p>Ten thousand negro men and women
may be able to sit down at the piano
and render Verdi’s “Il Trovatore,”
but does that entitle the negroes to
class themselves with the Italian composer?</p>

<p>My thought is this—the negro, assisted
in every possible way by the
whites, is copying the ways and learning
the arts of the white man; <i>but the
fact that he can learn to read the white
man’s book does not make him the equal
of the white race which produced the
book.</i> The fact that he may learn from
us how to practice law or medicine
does not make him equal to the white
race which <i>created</i> the code of laws and
the science of medicine. It may have
required a thousand years <i>for us to
learn</i> that which we can <i>teach him in
one year</i>, but the point is that the
negro, in his native home, had just as
much time and opportunity to evolve
a civilization as we had, <span class="smcap">and he did
not do it</span>.</p>

<p>Let me repeat to you, Doctor, the
unvarnished truth—for it may do you
good:</p>

<p>The advance made by your race in
America is <i>the reflection</i> of the white
man’s civilization. Just that and
nothing more. The negro lives in the
light of the white man’s civilization and
<i>reflects a part of that light</i>.</p>

<p>He imitates an example kept before
his eyes; copies models never out of his
sight; echoes the words the white man
utters; patterns after the manners and
the methods of the whites around him,
and thus <i>reflects</i> our civilization.</p>

<p>He has originated nothing, and if
the copy, the pattern, the example
were taken away he would fall back as
he did in Haiti.</p>

<p>He has never either evolved nor sustained
a civilization of his own.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the <i>Afro-American</i>,
he finds himself better situated
than his brethren elsewhere. In Africa
and Haiti <i>they</i> have to scuffle <i>for
themselves</i>. Result—barbarism.</p>

<p>In America <i>he</i> swells the ranks of
civilization’s advancing army, and he
<i>has</i> to go forward. We not only support
him with aid of all sorts, we not
only give him daily precept and example,
but we <i>compel</i> him to live a better life
than he would live in Africa and Haiti.
This compulsion is of two kinds, the
fear of punishment and the hope of reward—thus
enlisting two of the most
powerful passions of the human being.</p>

<p>It should be significant to Doctor
Washington that the only portion of
his race which has ever made any
development is that which has the
vast advantage of being sustained, encouraged,
taught, led and <i>coerced</i> by
the whites among whom they live.</p>

<p>Not long ago a negro preacher whose
self-appreciation was as great as that
of Doctor Washington went out to
Liberia to subdue the heathen, in the
home of the negro race.</p>

<p>The heathen were not subdued, but
the preacher was. He threw off his
store clothes, gave a whoop, gathered
up an armful of wives and broke for
the woods; the “Call of the Wild” was
too much for his newly soldered civilization.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t mean to say that Doctor
Washington would relapse, under
similar circumstances; but when I hear
him call his new race <i>Afro-Americans</i>
and listen while he soberly tells them
that <i>they are superior to the whites</i>, I beg
that he will remember his kin across
the sea, his brethren in Santo Domingo,
the decadents of Liberia, and the tens
of thousands of his race here in this
country who devoutly believe in witch
doctors, in ghosts, in the conjure bag,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[Pg 398]</span>
and in the power of one negro to undo
another by the mysterious but invincible
“Trick.”</p>

<p>Remember this, Doctor, education is
a good thing, but <i>it never did, and
never will, alter the essential character
of a man or a race</i>.</p>

<p>Of course, Doctor, if you think your
race the equal of ours, you have the
right to say it. It’s a free country,
you know.</p>

<p>But, really, you ought not to “crowd
the monkey” by putting in a claim for
superiority.</p>

<p><i>Such a claim does your race no good.</i></p>

<p>It <i>may</i> do them harm. It may cultivate
a spirit of truculent self-assertion
which even your warmest admirers,
North and South, might find it
hard to tolerate.</p>

<p>In the “History of Civilization,”
Buckle says:</p>

<p>“Above all this, there is a far higher
movement; and as the tide rolls on, now
advancing, now receding, there is, amid
its endless fluctuations, one thing, and
one alone, which endures forever. The
actions of bad men produce only temporary
evil, the actions of good men only
temporary good; and eventually the
good and the evil altogether subside, are
neutralized by subsequent generations,
absorbed by the incessant movement
of future ages. But the discoveries of
great men never leave us; they are immortal,
they contain those eternal truths
which survive the shock of empires,
outlive the struggle of rival creeds
and witness the decay of successive religions.
All <i>these</i> have their different
measures and their different standards;
one set of opinions for one age,
another set for another. <i>They</i> pass
away like a dream; they are as a fabric
of a vision, which leaves not a rack behind.
<i>The discoveries of genius alone
remain</i>: it is to <i>them</i> we owe all that
we now have, <i>they</i> are for all ages and
for all times; never young, and never
old, <i>they</i> bear the seeds of their own
life, they flow on in a perennial and
undying stream; <i>they</i> are essentially
cumulative, and giving birth to the
additions which they subsequently receive,
<i>they thus influence the most distant
posterity, and after the lapse of centuries
produce more effect than they were
able to do even at the moment of their
promulgation.</i>”</p>

<p>Noble lines!</p>

<p>And amid these “discoveries of
genius” to which “we owe all that we
now have,” bearing the seeds of intellectual
life and improvement to “the
most distant posterity” what treasures
are richer than those which the Latin
brings?</p>

<p>Architecture, Agriculture, Manufactures,
Commerce, Civil Engineering,
Finance, Legislation, Religious
Organization, Sculpture, Painting,
Music, Literature, Science, the wedding
of the Fine Arts to Religion—in each
and every one of these fields <i>his</i> genius
has been creative and masterful.</p>

<p><i>Upon our civilization the Latin has
imposed, as an everlasting blessing, an
imperishable Public Debt.</i></p>

<p>What does civilization owe to the
negro?</p>

<h3><i>Amending the Constitution</i></h3>

<p>I am not one of those who believe
that the Constitution of the United
States is a flawless piece of workmanship.</p>

<p>It was not so considered by those
who made it nor by those who adopted
it. It never would have been ratified
had it not been that amendments were
promised and misrepresentation made
as to the character of the instrument.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of discussion
recently about making a new
Constitution or amending the old.</p>

<p>When the Constitution was adopted
<i>a government was created</i> of which the
Constitution is the supreme law, and
<i>this cannot be changed except in the
manner prescribed in the instrument itself</i>.</p>

<p>If two-thirds of the states composing
the Union, acting through their legislatures,
shall apply to Congress for “a
Constitutional convention for proposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[Pg 399]</span>
amendments,” and these amendments
should be ratified by three-fourths
of the states, then a practically
new Constitution might be framed; but
in no other legal way could the people
alter the fundamental law.</p>

<p>Congress can take the initiative by
a vote of two-thirds of both Houses,
and can propose amendments which,
if adopted by three-fourths of the
states, would become a part of the
Constitution; but it must occur to all
that this method of effecting reform
is slow and cumbrous to the last degree.</p>

<p><i>The framers of the Constitution meant
that it should be so.</i></p>

<p>In a very able article in the last
number of this magazine Mr. Frederick
Upham Adams discusses the necessity
for amendments to the Constitution.</p>

<p>He cites four changes that should be
made.</p>

<p>First.—The election of President
and Vice-President should not be decided
by a majority of the states, but
by a majority of the people.</p>

<p>Second.—United States Senators
should not be elected by legislatures,
but by direct vote of the people of the
states.</p>

<p>Third.—The states should be represented
in the Senate according to
population.</p>

<p>Fourth.—The powers and functions
of the Federal Judiciary should be
enumerated and limited.</p>

<p>I heartily concur with Mr. Adams
in his view of the Federal Judiciary.
It has usurped functions and powers
unprecedented in the history of judicial
tribunals.</p>

<p>In order to change the character of
the government at Athens from an
aristocracy to a democracy Solon gave
the people control of the courts, which
<i>exercised the supreme power over laws
and men</i>. Aristotle says that by this
method the people established a democracy
where there had previously
been an aristocracy. The aristocrat
controlled the lawmaking power, but
as the people controlled the judiciary
a pure democracy resulted.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton used the same
device <i>for the opposite purpose</i>. He
took away from the people and put
into the hands of the aristocracy <i>the
supreme control over our laws and
rulers</i>, and our judiciary, thus controlled,
has changed the United States,
which under the old Confederation was
a democracy, into an aristocracy.</p>

<p>It will require a Constitutional
amendment to drive the usurpers from
the high place in which they are entrenched,
but such an amendment cannot
possibly be passed through the
<i>Upper House of Congress</i> and through
the <i>Upper Houses of three-fourths of the
states</i> until a tremendous revolution
shall have taken place in public sentiment.</p>

<p>If we should attempt to curtail the
powers of the Federal Judges by Constitutional
amendment we should surely
find “Jordan a hard road to travel.”
Most of us would be dead and forgotten
before the purpose could be reached
by that route.</p>

<p>What, then, can be done?</p>

<p><i>The swiftest remedy for the evil lies in
the election of a President who will</i>
<span class="smcap">assert his Executive Authority</span>.</p>

<p>The very essence of our system of
government is the <i>Balance of Power</i>.
The Legislative function should not
encroach upon the Judicial; the Executive
should not invade the Legislative,
and the Judicial should not
usurp prerogatives belonging to the
other two.</p>

<p><i>Inherent in each of these three departments
of government lies the power of
self-defense.</i></p>

<p>Just as the Government, as a whole,
has the inherent, inalienable right of
self-preservation against external or
internal attack, so each of the three
separate departments of the Government
has the inherent right of
self-preservation as against an attack
from either one or both of the other
two.</p>

<p>When John Marshall made the attempt
to encroach upon the Executive,
during the administration of Mr.
Jefferson, the President treated the
Court with contempt, and the Court
was powerless to go forward. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[Pg 400]</span>
the same partisan Judge made a decision
against the state of Georgia,
which President Andrew Jackson considered
unjust, the Executive refused
to support the Judiciary, and the decision
came to naught.</p>

<p>When Chief-Justice Taney, during
President Lincoln’s administration,
encroached, as the President thought,
upon the Executive, the Judiciary
again came to grief.</p>

<p><i>Had Mr. Cleveland been at heart in
favor of the Income tax of 1893, the
Supreme Court would never have dared
to pronounce against it.</i></p>

<p>That law was based upon a principle
which the Supreme Court had indorsed
for a hundred years, and the first deliverance
of the Judges upon the act
of 1893 was favorable to it.</p>

<p>That act was the outcome of the
work of the Legislative department
acting within the scope of its authority.
The Executive department had sanctioned
the act, and it had become
LAW.</p>

<p>Had Cleveland boldly announced
his purpose to <i>execute that law, by
virtue of his inherent power as Chief
Executive</i>, the Supreme Court would
never have made the second decision,
which was a national scandal.</p>

<p>By that decision the accumulated
wealth of the millionaires is exempted
from taxation—relieved of the duty of
contributing to the support of the
Government by whose unjust laws
those millions were accumulated.</p>

<p>But let the people really get in
power; let them really elect a President;
let them place in authority another
Andrew Jackson, who isn’t afraid
to show his friendship for the common
man and his animosity to the greedy
corporation—<i>then</i> you will see the
Supreme Court draw in its horns.</p>

<p>Federal Judges are human like the
rest of us, and they know with considerable
accuracy which side their
bread is buttered on.</p>

<p><i>Get the right sort of man in the Executive
Chair, get the right sort of men
in Congress, create the right sort of
public opinion, and I venture the prediction
that the Federal Judiciary will
not attempt the role of Dame Partington
without meeting with the same luck.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I agree with Mr. Adams also that
Senators should be elected by the direct
vote of the people in each state, but
he is perhaps in error when he says that
the system of electing Senators by
state legislatures is “the fountain head
of the corruption of American politics.”</p>

<p>On the contrary, there never could
have been a corrupt Senate until there
was a corrupt Legislature. When
New Jersey sent to the Senate a man
like Jim Smith the Legislature of New
Jersey had already become corrupt.
When Pennsylvania sent to the Senate
a man like Quay the Legislature of
Pennsylvania had already become corrupt.
Standard Oil had to buy the
Ohio Legislature before Henry B.
Payne became United States Senator.</p>

<p>In other words, the corrupt Senator
is simply the fruit of the tree of legislative
corruption, and the corrupt Legislature
has been too often the result of
corrupt elections.</p>

<p>We might as well tell the truth, and
the whole truth, while we are discussing
the question. <i>Every one of us
knows that elections of almost every sort,
from the highest to the lowest—town,
county, state and national—have been
influenced by money and whisky,
fraudulent practices of all sorts, the
stuffed ballot-box, the doctored returns,
and the God’s truth about the matter is
that the people themselves are, to a large
extent, responsible for the kind of men
who get into the Legislature, into the
House of Representatives and into the
Senate.</i></p>

<p>Too many of our honest men have
shirked election duty, as they have
shirked jury duty; and just as ignorant
or corrupt juries too often decide
questions in the court house, so the
ignorant or corrupt voters—pliant
tools in the hands of unscrupulous politicians—decide
questions of legislation
which require the best thought and the
best energies of our most intelligent
and upright citizens.</p>

<p>If direct legislation and the Recall
should be put in practice, there could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[Pg 401]</span>
not be such things as corrupt legislatures,
and therefore there would be no
such thing as corrupt senatorial elections.</p>

<p>The fountain having been purified,
the stream would be pure. At present
the fountain itself is too often impure,
and therefore the stream which flows
from it cannot be pure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the other two points made by
Mr. Adams there will be greater difference
of opinion. His objections proceed
upon the assumption that the
United States is a nation with a government
national in all particulars. Here
he is at fault.</p>

<p>Our Government is only partially
national. It is Federal, also, in part.
It is not altogether the one nor altogether
the other.</p>

<p>Ours is a peculiar system. To the
foreign world we present the aspect of
a sovereign nation. Among ourselves
we are a collection of sovereign states
which, for purposes stated in the preamble
of the Constitution, have delegated
to the central Government a
portion of those powers which once belonged
entirely to those sovereign states.</p>

<p>The state government existed before
the Federal Government came
into being. If the Federal Government
were abolished tomorrow, each
one of the states would still remain a
sovereign state capable of conducting
government.</p>

<p>The state of Connecticut, for instance,
was an independent republic
when there was no such thing as the
United States.</p>

<p>Would Connecticut ever have gone
into an “indissoluble union” if she had
not been assured that this union was
to be composed of “indestructible
states”? The two propositions are
linked together in Constitutional law.</p>

<p>Among sovereigns all are, in law,
equal, and each one of these states was
sovereign at the time the union of
states was formed.</p>

<p>Would either of those independent
sovereign states have accepted a place
of inferiority in the Government?
Assuredly not.</p>

<p>Then how is the indestructibility of
the states guaranteed in the Constitution?
By giving the state, as a state,
its full power in the United States
Senate, and, in a smaller degree, in the
election of Chief Magistrate.</p>

<p>The Constitution itself was modeled
by delegates chosen, not by citizens of
the United States, <i>acting as individuals
composing the entire nation</i>, but by
voters acting as <i>citizens composing distinct
and independent states to which
they respectively belonged</i>. When the
completed Constitution was referred
back to the people for adoption, it was
not acted upon by them as citizens of
the entire nation, but it was ratified by
each state, acting as a state, separate
and distinct from every other state.
<i>Therefore the Constitution itself is the
result, not of a national, but of a Federal
act.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Madison himself took this ground
in <i>The Federalist</i>. The facts all prove
it.</p>

<p>In the exercise of its legislative powers
the Federal Government is both
national and Federal. The House of
Representatives is a national body, because
it is composed of members chosen
according to population. The Senate
is a Federal body, because it is chosen
by the states, acting as states.</p>

<p>The executive department of our
Government also combines in itself
both the national and the Federal features.</p>

<p>The Electoral College is composed
of two messengers from each state, and
also of messengers equal in number to
the members which the state has in the
House of Representatives.</p>

<p>The two messengers first mentioned
correspond with the two Senators, and
therefore represent the state in its
Federal capacity. The other messengers
correspond with the Representatives
of the state in the Lower House,
and as the Lower House is national, so
those messengers are national.</p>

<p>If the people fail to elect a President,
and the election is thrown into the
House of Representatives, <i>this House,
which in its organization as a legislative
body is national, at once becomes Federal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[Pg 402]</span>
because each state has one vote, and the
voice of Ohio or Pennsylvania is not
more potent than that of Rhode Island or
Delaware</i>.</p>

<p>It is only when our Government
comes to put its laws into operation
that it is purely national.</p>

<p>It is not strictly correct, politically
or legally, to say that the United
States is a nation, for a nation does
not properly exist when the Government
is one of limited power. That
our Government is one of limited
power, absolute only within the sphere
of action granted to it by the states,
cannot be denied. While secession
has been forever decided as not being
among the reserved rights of the
states, there are very many other reserved
rights which still belong to the
states, and which always should be
retained.</p>

<p>As the Washington <i>Post</i> remarked
some time since: “The United States
has not a single voter, and does not
hold elections for any office. <i>All
elections are state elections.</i>”</p>

<p>Already there has been too much
concentration of power in the central
Government. To take away from the
states their power of selecting Senators
would be nothing short of revolution,
and would lead to such a consolidation
of power as would entirely change the
form and spirit of our Government.</p>

<p>If the principles of Populism grow
strong enough to carry the large states
they will probably be found strong
enough to carry the small states. If
they be found strong enough to control
the state elections, they will control
national offices, because, as the
Washington Post very aptly points
out, <i>the Federal Government holds no
elections and has no voters</i>: it is the
state that holds the election and
furnishes the voters; it is the state
that prescribes the limits of the
franchise, and says how, when, where
and by whom these elections shall be
held; <i>and even the Federal Judiciary
has not yet ventured to infringe in the
slightest degree upon that reserved right
of the separate states</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Speaking of the equal representation
of the states in the Senate, Mr.
Adams says, “<i>This vicious compromise
was made in the Constitutional Convention
as the price for the perpetuation
of slavery.</i>”</p>

<p>This compromise he characterizes
further as “<i>cowardly and unfair</i>.”
And he adds: “Now that the logic of
events has made this a nation, despite
the restrictive clauses of the Constitution,
the dual participation of the
unrepresentative Senate is so grotesque
that its continuance is fraught
with a danger which at any time is
likely to precipitate civil war.”</p>

<p>Is Mr. Adams quite sure that “this
vicious compromise was the price of
the perpetuation of slavery”?</p>

<p>Of course, I knew in a general way
that slavery had been responsible for
pretty nearly every mean old thing
that has ever happened to this country;
and it has always grieved me, with
more or less poignancy, that New England
could not have <i>foreseen</i> that she
couldn’t make slavery pay. We lost
much precious time while she was discovering
that she couldn’t. When at
length she <i>did</i> discover that there was
no money in it for <i>her</i>, she thoughtfully
sold most of her slaves, and
went in for Emancipation.</p>

<p><i>Then</i>, to be sure, the sacred “Cause
of Freedom” advanced at a gallop;
but, as I said, we had lost a good deal
of time waiting for New England to
make her experiment, and a good deal
of unhappiness resulted.</p>

<p>But while I knew all this, in a general
way, I really was not aware that the
slave-owning states in the Constitutional
Convention forced Washington,
Madison, Franklin and Randolph to
act in the cowardly and vicious manner
described by Mr. Adams.</p>

<p>The state of Virginia bitterly opposed
the equal representation of the
states in the Senate. This was strange
conduct in Virginia, if the purpose of
that compromise was the “perpetuation
of slavery.”</p>

<p>The state of New Jersey was the
leader of those states in the convention
which demanded equal representation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[Pg 403]</span>
in the Senate. If that senatorial
equality was intended to perpetuate
slavery, New Jersey’s attitude
was most peculiar.</p>

<p>This compromise which Mr. Adams
calls “vicious, cowardly and unfair”
is known to constitutional history
as <i>the Connecticut Compromise</i>.
The men who championed it most
ably were Roger Sherman and Oliver
Ellsworth. Were these men actuated
by a desire to perpetuate slavery?</p>

<p>All the books which I have read
upon the subject state that equal
representation in the Senate was a
compromise which <i>the smaller states
wrung from the larger states, as the
price of the union</i>, not the price of the
“perpetuation of slavery.”</p>

<p>New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware
were afraid to give up their independent,
sovereign existence as states
and to go into a union where the large
states, like Pennsylvania and Virginia,
would have so much greater power
than themselves, if that power should
be based on population.</p>

<p>When New Jersey refused to consider
any plan of union which did not
safeguard the interests of the small
states, she was not thinking of perpetuating
slavery. When Roger Sherman
and Oliver Ellsworth made such
a determined fight to preserve, in part,
the equality which then prevailed
among the states, they were not thinking
of perpetuating slavery. <i>Their
motive was to protect Connecticut, the
small state, against Virginia and other
large states.</i></p>

<p>When Benjamin Franklin finally
proposed that the Convention adopt
the Connecticut idea, that aged philosopher
and friend of human liberty
was not acting in the interest of the
slave-owners.</p>

<p>When Washington gave his consent,
he was not guilty of cowardice and
unfairness for the purpose of protecting
slavery.</p>

<p>These men knew perfectly well that
they were exceeding their authority
in making a <i>new</i> Constitution. They
were sent there <i>to amend</i> the Articles
of Confederation; and when New Jersey,
Connecticut and Delaware took
the resolute position which was voiced
by Patterson, Roger Sherman and
Oliver Ellsworth, Washington and
Franklin both had sense enough to
know that it would be utter folly to go
before the people, seeking a ratification
of <i>a new Constitution</i>, unless the difference
between big states and little states
had been first adjusted in the Constitutional
Convention. Indeed, Rhode
Island, another small state, was so
jealous of her rights that she refused to
send delegates to the Convention.</p>

<p>My authorities are Bancroft’s “History
of the United States,” “The
Constitutional History” of Landon,
McMaster’s “With the Fathers,” Hildreth’s
“History of the United States,”
Schouler’s “History of the United
States.”</p>

<p>The latter historian says expressly
that the compromise under discussion
“<i>was secured through the determination
of the smaller states not to yield entirely
the rule of representation which the
larger states were bent on invading</i>,” and,
he adds, “<i>this compromise admirably
preserves the composite character of our
system</i>.”</p>

<p>The historian declares that the
smaller states expressly committed to
the New Jersey plan which sought to
retain the sovereignty of the states
were New Jersey, Connecticut and
Delaware.</p>

<p>Hildreth, in his “History of the
United States,” takes the same position,
and says: “The party of the smaller
states, known also as the State Rights
Party, included the delegates from
Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and
a majority of those from Maryland and
New York.</p>

<p>“The party of the larger states, or
National Party, included not only <i>the
delegates from Virginia, Massachusetts
and Pennsylvania</i>, but also those from
<i>the two Carolinas and Georgia</i>, states
which anticipated a very rapid increase
of population.”</p>

<p>(I could quote Woodrow Wilson to
the same effect, only Woodrow isn’t
worth while.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[Pg 404]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now it must occur to Mr. Adams
that these facts are at war with his
theory.</p>

<p>Virginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,
the two Carolinas and Georgia
would never have been found opposing
the equality of representation of the
states in the Senate if the purpose of
that senatorial equality was the perpetuation
of the institution of slavery.</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> a compromise which the
slave-owners wrung as a concession
from the free states, but this compromise
benefited them <i>in the lower
House, not in the Senate</i>.</p>

<p>When the Constitution gave the
slave states representation based upon
<i>three-fifths of the slaves</i>, the institution
of slavery derived strength from the
<i>national idea</i> of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts
and Virginia—<i>not from the
State Rights idea</i> of New Jersey, Delaware
and Connecticut.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>“<i>Take the Children</i>”</h3>

<p>In France the Privileged Classes
had created a situation which pleased
them perfectly.</p>

<p>A fifth of the soil belonged to 30,000
noble families; another fifth belonged
to the clergy; another fifth belonged
to the king and city governments; the
remaining two-fifths belonged to all
the other people, middle class and
peasants.</p>

<p>To the support of the Government
the clergy contributed nothing except
as a free gift; the nobility contributed
pretty much what they pleased, and
they did not please to contribute a
great deal.</p>

<p>The king’s family spent $55,000,000
per year. Two brothers of the king
spent $2,000,000; and, to pay the debts
of one princely bankrupt, King Louis
XVI took $3,000,000 out of the public
funds.</p>

<p>Two hundred and ninety-five cooks
served in the king’s kitchen. Nearly
two thousand horses stood in his
stables. A squad of soldiers escorted
his dinner to the table. A magnificent
band furnished music while he
ate, and a dozen gallant lords, paid
for the service, helped him to undress
and get to bed when the arduous do-nothing
of the day had been finished.</p>

<p>Some 30,000,000 Frenchmen did not
enter into this world of privilege. The
merchant, the lawyer, the doctor, the
manufacturer, the farmer, the laborer—all
these stood outside the pearly gates,
catching only a glimpse of the radiance
within, hearing only, as from a distance,
the music of this Eden, created
by class legislation.</p>

<p>The peasant neither owned his land
absolutely nor <i>himself</i> absolutely. Over
him and his was suspended the heavy
sword of class privilege.</p>

<p>The noble hunter of game, who enjoyed
the exclusive privilege of killing
game, might trample down his grain
with the utmost unconcern, at whatever
time the pleasure of the noble
huntsman dictated. Mr. Peasant was
not allowed to protect his fields and
crops by putting up any kind of inclosure.</p>

<p>Mr. Peasant must not kill the wild
boar or the antlered stag, even though
those noble beasts, reserved for noble
huntsmen, were destroying the crop
upon which he and his family were dependent
for a living.</p>

<p>He could not, under any conditions
whatsoever, destroy the pigeons which
came sweeping down upon his grain,
nor must he, during certain seasons,
manure his crop or hoe out the grass,
lest he injure the flavor of the young
partridges, and deprive them of the
shelter necessary for their comfort and
growth.</p>

<p>He could not press his grapes save
at the nobleman’s wine-press, nor grind
his wheat save at the nobleman’s mill,
nor bake his bread elsewhere than in
the nobleman’s oven.</p>

<p>These monopolies were peculiar to
the lord, and the peasant must pay
toll lest the lord’s revenues decrease.</p>

<p>The peasant could not vote, had
really no civic existence, was not considered
in the government of the country;
could be made to work whether
he wished to do so or not for the noble
and the king. His horses could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[Pg 405]</span>
taken from the cart, or from the plow,
if his superiors demanded it. Neither
for his labor nor his horse was he paid.
He could not put salt into his victuals
without paying a high price for it, and
he was not allowed to eat his victuals
unsalted. The law <i>compelled</i> him to
buy a certain portion of salt every year
at an exorbitant price.</p>

<p>The church took from him one-tenth
of all he made, besides which he must
pay fees for christenings, marriages,
burials and pardons for sins—to say
nothing of prayers in behalf of the living,
the dying and the dead. The
feudal lord took from him annually a
certain part of all he made.</p>

<p>The French historian Taine says that
in some portions of France the peasant
paid in feudal dues, church tithes and
royal taxes <i>more than three-fourths of
all that he made</i>. In other portions of
France <i>the entire net produce of the soil
went to the church and state</i>, and so great
was the intolerable burden that <i>the
peasants quit in despair, left the land to
become a desert waste, and flocked to the
cities to swell the army of The Wretched</i>.</p>

<p>To throw off the shackles of this
frightful system of misgovernment the
French Revolutionist roused the people.</p>

<p>At first Great Britain rejoiced in the
movement which Lafayette, Mirabeau,
Necker, Sieyès and Camille Desmoulins
inaugurated. These early revolutionists
declared their purpose to set up a
constitutional government in France
such as Great Britain enjoyed, but
when these moderate and constitutional
reformers were thrown aside by
the radical democrats who were determined
to establish a republic—when
this democracy had confiscated the
lands held by the church, had issued
paper money and had taken for national
uses the abandoned estates of
the immigrant nobles, the ruling powers
of church and state in Great Britain
became greatly alarmed, and it was resolved
that war to the death should be
waged against the principles of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>Unless this were done, democracy
might assert itself in Great Britain, and
those things which had been taken
from the people under forms of law
might be restored in the same way to
the original owners. Therefore William
Pitt, Prime Minister and actual
ruler of Great Britain, declared war
upon France, blockaded her coasts,
organized European kings into confederacies
against her, and for more
than a dozen dreadful years poured
armed legions upon her.</p>

<p>During this era of “blood and iron”
men were torn from peaceful pursuits
throughout Great Britain to supply
the navy and the army with food for
powder.</p>

<p>As a necessary consequence, the demand
for labor was greater than the supply;
and as England depends especially
upon her manufactures, it was there
that the scarcity of labor was most injuriously
felt.</p>

<p>It is said that a deputation representing
the manufacturers waited upon
the Prime Minister and laid their
grievances before him, asking the question,
“<i>What must we do?</i>”</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt is reported to have answered,
“<span class="smcap">Take the Children</span>.”</p>

<p>This story may not be true, but it is
a fact that it represented precisely the
emergency, and the manner in which
that emergency was met. It also
represents correctly the attitude of Mr.
Pitt as defined in his speeches in Parliament.</p>

<p>A cruel, unjustifiable war had devoured
the laborer who should have
been at his task. The laws had
dragged him into the army and into
the navy whether he wished to go or
not. Press-gangs had prowled about
the lanes and alleys clutching at every
poor man who happened to be sound
of limb, and had carried him off by
force into a battleship, where he might
be kept until the bride whom he had
left at the church door had counted
him as dead, or until the family which
he had left contented and happy had
been lost to the knowledge of men.</p>

<p><i>Having taken the father, the same
remorseless class-greed demanded the
child, and took it.</i></p>

<p>Upon the altar of English lust for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[Pg 406]</span>
money has been sacrificed more helpless
men, women and children than
ever fell before the ruthless hordes
of Tamerlane or Attila.</p>

<p>“Within carefully guarded limits,
child-labor is no more to be objected
to in manufactures than in agriculture,
but in the early days of the factory
system these limits were utterly discarded.</p>

<p>“In the infancy of the system it
became the custom of the master manufacturers
to contract with the managers
of workhouses throughout England
and of the charities of Scotland,
to send their young children to the
factories of the great towns. <i>Many
thousands of children between the ages
of six and ten</i> were thus sent, absolutely
uncared for and unprotected,
and left to the complete disposal of
masters who often had not a single
thought except speedily to amass a
fortune, and <i>who knew that if the first
supply of infant labor were used up
there was still much more to be obtained</i>.</p>

<p>“Thousands of children at this early
age might be found working in the
factories of England and Scotland,
usually from twelve to fourteen, sometimes
even fifteen and sixteen hours
a day, not unfrequently during the
greater part of the night. <i>Destitute
or drunken or unnatural parents made
it a regular system to raise money by
hiring out their children from six, sometimes
from five, years old, by written
contracts and for long periods. In one
case brought before Parliament a gang
of these children was put up for sale
among a bankrupt’s effects, and publicly
advertised as part of the property.</i>
In another an agreement was disclosed
between a London parish and a
Lancashire manufacturer in which
it was stipulated that <i>with every
twenty sound children one idiot should
be taken</i>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Even as late as 1840, when the
most important manufactures had
been regulated by law, Lord Ashley
was able to show that <i>boys employed
in the carpet manufacture at Kidderminster
were called up at three and
four in the morning, and kept working
sixteen or eighteen hours</i>: that children
five years old were engaged in the
unhealthy trade of pin-making, and
were kept at work from six in the
morning to eight at night.” (Lecky,
“England in Eighteenth Century.”)</p>

<p>In the coal mines and in the salt
mines men, women and children were
literally beasts of burden—were chattels,
and when the mines were sold the
human machines passed from one owner
to another just as the mechanical
apparatus passed.</p>

<p>There were women who in these
coal mines, where the tunnels were
too narrow to allow them to stand
upright, had to crawl back and
forward on their hands and knees for
fourteen to sixteen hours a day, drawing
after them the trucks loaded
with coal.</p>

<p><i>These trucks were securely fastened
to the woman by means of a chain
which passed between her legs and was
attached to a belt strapped round her
waist. The woman seldom wore any
clothes except an old pair of trousers
made of sacking.</i></p>

<p>“Little children were forced to
work underground from year to year.
Deep in the gloom of a night which
had neither moonlight nor stars;
rarely ever seeing the face of nature
and of day—lost to God’s glory of sunlight,
shady woods, silvery waters—lost
to intelligence, happiness, enjoyment,
reduced to the helpless condition
of beasts of burden.”</p>

<p>What was true of the mines was
also true of the factories.</p>

<p>Men, women and children were
forced to work for a number of hours
absolutely inconsistent with physical
and moral development.</p>

<p>In the year 1833 Lord Ashley led
in the noble effort to redeem the children
from the clutches of unscrupulous
commercialism, and to lighten the
burden of men and women by regulating
the hours of labor and the conditions
of service.</p>

<p>After a most stubborn resistance,
in which the corporations urged against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[Pg 407]</span>
the reform every reason which we
hear urged in our day, England did
herself the immense credit of checking
the tyranny of those who were grinding
the lives out of the poor in order that
the rich should become richer.</p>

<p>In this country the cry of commercialism
is the same as that which in
Great Britain said, “<i>Take the children</i>.”</p>

<p>Corporations want cheap labor. If
they can’t get the adult, they take
the child.</p>

<p>In the Southern states the tendency
to employ children has had alarming
development. In 1880 the total number
of cotton factory employees was
16,740. Of these, 4,090 were children
under sixteen years of age. In
the year 1900 the total number of
employees had increased to 97,559.
Of these, 24,459 <i>were children under
sixteen years of age</i>.</p>

<p>In the states outside of the South
there were, in 1880, 155,803 employees
in cotton factories. Of this number,
24,243 were children under sixteen
years of age. In the year 1900 the
total number of cotton factory employees
in states outside of the South
was 205,302. Of these, only 15,796
were children under sixteen years of
age.</p>

<p>In other words, within the Southern
states the children under sixteen years
of age constitute now, as they did
twenty years ago, <i>25 per cent. of all
the operatives employed</i>: whereas, <i>in
the states outside the South the children
under sixteen number less than 8 per
cent. of all those employed</i>. Therefore
the situation which was justly
considered so bad in Great Britain
that it was reformed seventy years
ago, and which has been reformed
in most of the states outside of the
South, is three times worse in the
South than it is in any other portion
of the Union, <i>and is just as bad now
as it was twenty years ago</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>The Tradesman</i>, of Chattanooga,
Tenn., August 15, 1902, the statement
is made that the number of children
under sixteen years of age now at work
in the Southern mills approximated
50,000.</p>

<p>The 50,000 little ones who troop to
the mill every morning, breathe the
steam-heated, dust-laden, germ-infected
atmosphere of the close rooms
throughout the entire day, who light,
with lanterns, their way home across
the fields when darkness has fallen,
are white children. During the same
hours that these white boys and girls
are finding their way to the factory
where their energy and strength is offered
up as a sacrifice to mammon,
50,000 black children are singing merrily
on their way to school, <i>where they
are gaining what the white children are
losing</i>.</p>

<p>Glance forward twenty years and
ask yourselves what will be the relative
positions of the 50,000 white children
and the 50,000 black children. <i>It
will be a miracle if most of those white
children are not either in their graves,
or in the hospitals, or in the slums, or
in the prisons, while the 50,000 black
children will be holding clerkships in
some department of the Federal Government.</i></p>

<p>The kind of civilization which we
are going to have in the future is being
determined now. Race development
and progress cannot be extemporized
or bought ready-made. It is a matter
of preparing the soil, planting the seed,
cultivating the crop.</p>

<p>We shall reap as we shall have sown.</p>

<p>The most profoundly disgusting feature
of the Southern political situation
today is that <i>the Democratic bosses who
control our state legislatures will not allow
us to give our white children as good
treatment as the negro children are getting</i>.</p>

<p>Almost universally the Southern
mills are controlled by Northern capitalists;
but it is the Southern politician,
officeholder, editor or stockholder
who rushes to the legislature
saying that <i>child slavery must continue
because it is good for the child</i>.</p>

<p>These Northern capitalists who own
Southern mills are, to a large extent,
Republicans in politics. The unprincipled
Southern men who put up a
plea in behalf of child slavery are almost
exclusively Democratic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[Pg 408]</span></p>

<p>Just as J. P. Morgan, the Republican
railroad king, uses the Southern
Democratic machine to rob the people
through his railroads, so the Northern
Republican millowner uses the Southern
Democratic politician to rivet upon
the Southern white child the chains of
commercial serfdom, <i>ruinous to the
child and ominous to the future of the
white race in the South</i>.</p>

<p>It was class-greed which first raised
the cry, “<i>Take the children</i>.” It is
class-greed which <i>now</i> says, “<span class="smcap">Take the
Children</span>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><i>Paternalism</i></h3>

<p>One of the dreadfulest words that
ever scared a mossback is “Paternalism.”</p>

<p>He does not know what it means,
and he does not want to know. He
flees from it as from something too
blood-curdling to look upon. His
leaders, his orators, his editors, have all
told him that no language could fully
describe the horrors of “Paternalism”;
and therefore he feels that while
poverty, slavery, hunger and starvation
are sometimes annoying incidents
in life, they bear no comparison
to the pitiless rigors of “Paternalism.”</p>

<p>He has got used to unmerciful taxes,
to ill-paid labor, to squalid surroundings,
to empty pockets, and to the cry
of children hungering for bread. All
these discomforts he can stand, because
they have come to him in the
natural course of events under the rule
of Democracy and Republicanism.
But the very idea of a new party
springing up and practicing “Paternalism”
unnerves him. He fears he
couldn’t stand it.</p>

<p>We had this terror-stricken victim
of Democratic bugabooism in mind today
when we read the decision of
Cleveland’s Attorney-General, to the
effect that whisky in a bonded warehouse
could not be reached by process
from a State Court.</p>

<p>Under a law which has stealthily
slipped upon the statute-book while
the people were not noticing, the
producers of distilled liquors get the
privilege of storing their “firewater”
in a government warehouse and getting
a certificate of deposit.</p>

<p>The Government takes care of the
whisky until the owner feels like paying
a tax upon it.</p>

<p>Formerly, under an act passed by
Republicans and Democrats, this exemption
from tax lasted three years.
At the last session of Congress the
Democrats, out of tender consideration
for the poor, downtrodden
Whisky Trust, extended this exemption
to eight years.</p>

<p>The great and good Government of
the United States, therefore, steps
forward through its officers, and
kindly says to the distiller: “Hand me
your whisky bottle: I’ll take care of it
for you until you get ready to pay
your taxes.”</p>

<p>Not only does our great and good
Government say substantially these
very words to the distiller, but it
guards his whisky bottle so jealously
that no writ or execution or other
process from a State Court is allowed
to touch the liquor which is thus being
held by the Government for the benefit
of the owner.</p>

<p>Governor Tillman, of South Carolina,
tried to bring his power as Chief
Magistrate of a sovereign state to bear
on some of the whisky which Uncle
Sam was taking care of for the Whisky
Trust, but the voice of our great and
good Government was promptly heard
saying, “Keep off the Grass.”</p>

<p>Brave Benjamin had to let the
whisky alone.</p>

<p>The certificate of deposit issued on
the liquor by the Government to the
distiller becomes at once valuable
commercial paper upon which he can
get any amount of money he wants.</p>

<p>He can go to New York, borrow
money on his certificate at 2 per cent.,
and use it for eight years without
difficulty, because the money-lenders
have the certificate which shows to
them that the Government is taking
good care of the whisky all the time.</p>

<p>Is this “Paternalism”?</p>

<p>If so, please don’t mention it to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[Pg 409]</span>
mossback whom we have described.
It might make him run away and
tear the buggy up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><i>Planting Corn</i></h3>

<p>The bluebird was out today; out in
his glossiest plumage, his throat gurgling
with song.</p>

<p>For the sunlight was warm and
radiant in all the South, and the
coming spring had laid its benediction
on every field and hedge and forest.</p>

<p>The smell of newly plowed ground
mingled with the subtle incense of
the yellow jasmine; and from every
orchard a shower of the blossoms of
peach and apple and pear was wafted
into the yard and hung lovingly on
the eaves and in the piazzas of the old
homestead—the old and faded homestead.</p>

<p>Was there a cloud in all the sky?
Not one, not one.</p>

<p>“Gee! Mule!!!”</p>

<p>“Dad blast your hide, why don’t
you gee-e-EE!!”</p>

<p>Co-whack! goes the plowline on the
back of the patient mule—the dignified
upholder of mortgages, “time
price” accounts, and the family credit
generally.</p>

<p>Down the furrow, and up the furrow;
down to the woods, and up to the fence—there
they go, the sturdy plowman
and his much-enduring but indispensable
mule.</p>

<p>For the poplar leaves are now as
big as squirrel-ears and it’s “time to
plant corn.”</p>

<p>On moves the plowman, steady as a
clock, silent and reflective.</p>

<p>Right after him comes the corndropper,
dropping corn.</p>

<p>The grains faintly chink as the bare
feet of the corndropper hurry past;
and before the corn has well cuddled
itself into the shoe-heel of the plowman’s
track, down comes the hoe of
the “coverer”—and then the seeds
pass into the portals of the great unknown;
the unknown of burial, of
death and of life renewed.</p>

<p>Peeping from the thicket, near at
hand, the royal redbird makes note
of what is going on, nor is the thrush
blind to the progress of the corndropper.
And seated with calm but
watchful dignity on the highest pine
in the thicket sits the melancholy
crow, sharpening his appetite with all
the anticipated pleasures of simple
larceny.</p>

<p>The mocking-bird circles and swoops
from tree to tree, and in her matchless
bursts of varied song no cadence is
wanting, no melody missed.</p>

<p>The hum of the bees is in the air;
white butterflies, like snowflakes, fall
down the light and lazily float away.</p>

<p>The robin lingers about the China
tree, and the bluejay, lifting his plumed
frontlet, picks a quarrel with every
feathered acquaintance and noisily
asserts his grievances.</p>

<p>The jo-ree has dived deeper into the
thicket, and the festive sapsucker, he
of the scarlet crest, begins to come to
the front, inquisitive as to the location
of bugs and worms.</p>

<p>On such a day, such a cloudless,
radiant, flower-sweetened day, the
horseman slackens the rein as he rides
through lanes and quiet fields; and he
dares to dream that the children of
God once loved each other.</p>

<p>On such a day one may dream that
the time might come when they would
do so again.</p>

<p>Rein in and stop, here on this high
hill! Look north, look east where
the sun rises, look south, look west
where the sun sets—on all sides the
scene is the same. In every field the
steady mule, the steady plowman and
the children dropping corn.</p>

<p>Close the eye a moment and look at
the picture fancy paints. Every field
in Georgia is there, every field in the
South is there. And in each the figures
are the same—the steady mule
and the steady man, and the pattering
feet of the children dropping corn.</p>

<p>In these furrows lie the food of the
republic; on these fields depend life,
and health and happiness.</p>

<p>Halt those children—and see how
the cheek of the world would blanch
at thought of famine!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[Pg 410]</span></p>

<p>Paralyze that plowman—and see
how national bankruptcy would shatter
every city in the Union.</p>

<p>Dropping corn! A simple thing, you
say.</p>

<p>And yet, as those white seeds rattle
down to the sod and hide away for a
season, it needs no peculiar strength
of fancy to see a Jacob’s ladder
crowded with ascending blessings.</p>

<p>Scornfully the railroad king would
glance at these small teams in each
small field; yet check those corndroppers
and his cars would rot on
the road and rust would devour the
engines in the roundhouse. The
banker would ride through those fields
thinking only of his hoarded millions,
nor would he ever startle himself with
the thought that his millions would
melt away in mist were those tiny
hands never more to be found dropping
corn. The bondholder, proud in all
the security of the untaxed receiver
of other people’s taxes, would see in
these fields merely the industry from
which he gathers tribute; it would never
dawn on his mind that without the
opening of those furrows and the
hurrying army of children dropping
corn his bond wouldn’t be worth the
paper it is written on.</p>

<p>Yet it is literally so.</p>

<p>Feed the world, and it can live,
work, produce and march on. Starve
it, and what becomes of railroads,
banks, mills, mines, notes, mortgages
and bonds?</p>

<p>Great is the might of this republic!—great
in its schools, churches, courts,
legislatures; great in its towns and
cities; great in its commerce, great in
its manufactures, great in its colossal
wealth.</p>

<p>But sweep from under it all these
worn and wasted fields, strike into
idleness or death the plowman, his
wife and his child, and what becomes
of the gorgeous structure whose foundation
is his field?</p>

<p>Halt the food growers, and what
becomes of your gold and its “intrinsic
value”?</p>

<p>How much of your gold can you
eat?</p>

<p>How many of your diamonds will
answer the need of a loaf?</p>

<p>But enough.</p>

<p>It is time to ride down the hill.
The tinkle of the cow-bell follows the
sinking sun—both on the way home.</p>

<p>So with many an unspoken thought
I ride homeward, thinking of those who
plant the corn.</p>

<p>And hard indeed would be the heart
that, knowing what these people do
and bear and suffer, yet would not
fashion this prayer to the favored of
the republic: “O rulers, lawmakers,
soldiers, judges, bankers, merchants,
editors, lawyers, doctors, preachers,
bondholders! <i>Be not so unmindful of
the toil and misery of those who feed
you!</i>”</p>

of corporation tyranny?</p>

<p>Did you know that as soon as <i>the
corporations which are working in coal
and iron</i> got tired of said monopoly
and began to complain, our great and
good Government at once had ears to
hear and eyes that could see?</p>

<p>Did you know that patriots of the
Carnegie stripe, who had to pay tribute
to the Monongahela monopoly, were
losing $425,000 per year to said monopoly;
<i>and that Carnegie and Company
went to our great and good Government
and demanded that said Government
buy out said Monongahela monopoly</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[Pg 412]</span></p>

<p>Did you know that our great and
good Government immediately harkened
to the wails of Carnegie and his
Company <i>and appointed a commission
to assess the value of said Monongahela
monopoly</i>?</p>

<p>Did you know that said monopoly,
being wise in its generation, realized
that its hour had come and that its
best policy was to sell out at a high
price?</p>

<p><i>Did you know that the Commission
appraised the monopoly franchise at
more than three and a half million dollars,
and that our great and good Government
paid the money?</i></p>

<p>Did you know that <i>your cash</i> was
thus lifted out of the Treasury <i>to pay
for a free river for Carnegie and his
Company</i>; and that nobody thought it
worth while to say “Turkey” to you
about it?</p>

<p>This buying-off of the private monopoly
which throttled the commerce
of a great section was a good thing to
do. We are glad it was done. The
people can now navigate the Monongahela
as freely as Carnegie can do it;
but is it not mortifying to reflect <i>that
the PEOPLE were powerless against the
wrong until the coal and iron kings
took the case in hand</i>?</p>

<p>And isn’t it amazing to see how easily
the doors of the Treasury fly open,
and the millions pour out, when the
Privileged Corporations want it done?</p>

<p>When it became a matter of self-interest
to the Privileged Corporations
to buy out the Monongahela monopoly
the Constitution was not in the way
nor was the money lacking.</p>

<p>Whenever it suits the same Privileged
Classes to unload the Railroads
on to the Government at fancy prices
it will be done. When that day comes
the Constitution will not be in the way
nor will the means be lacking.</p>

<p>Whenever the Privileged Classes
want <span class="smcap">anything</span> done the Constitution
approves and the cash box is full.</p>

<p>It is only when the masses want
anything done that our Constitution
becomes a fretful porcupine with quills
erect and our cash box has a hollow
sound.</p>

<p>If you want to have a jolly time
with that gay old creature, the United
States Constitution, join the Privileged
Corporations.</p>

<p>If you want to frolic with the United
States Treasury and pay for what you
want with public money, join the
Privileged Corporations.</p>

<h3><i>Rural Free Delivery to Country People</i></h3>

<p class="blockquot">(Extract from the <i>People’s Party
Paper</i>, March, 1893, Mr. Watson’s
paper, commenting upon the passage of
the <i>first appropriation</i> for the R. F. D.)</p>

<p>The annual appropriations for the
free delivery of mails was, until the
present administration, confined to
cities of over 10,000 inhabitants. At
the suggestion of Mr. Wanamaker, an
experiment was made in smaller towns
enjoying daily mails, but as yet no
country neighborhoods had obtained
the privilege.</p>

<p>On Friday, February 17, 1893, when
the annual appropriation was pending,
Mr. Watson proposed an amendment as
follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">For free delivery service, including existing
experimental free delivery offices,
$11,254,900, of which the sum of $10,000
shall be applied, under the direction of the
Postmaster-General, to experimental free
delivery in rural communities other than
towns and villages.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson urged that the paragraph
proposed to be amended “provides
for the expenditure of $11,254,943
for free delivery service. The
amendment reduced the amount of
that expenditure and simply directed
that the Postmaster-General should
apply $10,000 of the appropriation to
experimental free delivery in rural
communities.” The following discussion
followed:</p>

<p><i>Mr. Watson</i>—“Mr. Chairman, the
present law provides for an experimental
free delivery in rural communities;
but as I understand it—and the
chairman of the committee, the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr. Henderson),
makes the same statement to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[Pg 413]</span>
the House—<i>the law has been construed
to mean cities, towns and villages</i>, and
there are now in operation experimental
free deliveries in certain towns
and villages.</p>

<p>“The law expressly provides for
‘rural communities,’ and it seems to
me where the general laws make such
provision there is no hardship in taking
a small amount from this appropriation,
only $10,000, and appropriating
it for <i>experimental free delivery in absolutely
rural communities</i>, that is to say,
<i>in the country pure and simple, among
the farmers, in those neighborhoods
where they do not get their mail more
than once in every two weeks, and where
these deserving people have settled in communities
one hundred years old and do
not receive a newspaper that is not two
weeks behind the times</i>.</p>

<p>“The amendment proposes not to
increase the appropriation; it actually
diminishes it by a nominal amount, but
takes $10,000 of it to be provided for
<i>experimental free delivery in absolutely
rural communities, instead of towns and
villages, which the authorities construe
to mean ‘rural communities.’</i> In other
words, I think that part of the money
ought to be spent <i>in the country</i>, where
the law provides it shall be spent, and
having made this statement, if we can
have another division, and the committee
is against my amendment, I will
yield to its will.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Henderson, of North Carolina</i>—“Mr.
Chairman, the only law on the subject
at all is in the very language used
in this appropriation bill:</p>

<p>“‘For free delivery service, including
existing experimental free delivery
offices.’</p>

<p>“That is all the law now on the statute-books
in regard to this question.</p>

<p>“<i>I do not want the statement of the
gentleman from Georgia in regard to
there being a law on the statutes as to
rural free delivery to go without correction.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Watson</i>—“Mr. Chairman, <i>this
delivery in the small towns and villages is
called ‘rural free delivery.’</i>”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Henderson, of North Carolina</i>—“But
as a matter of fact <i>there is no
law</i> except that stated here in this appropriation
bill.”</p>

<p>The amendment was adopted by the
House. This opens up the way for the
farmers to secure services on an equal
footing with the residents of the towns
and the cities. It is one of the first
instances in which the Government has
put itself in daily touch with the citizen
of the rural community. If followed
up by successive Congresses, this entering
wedge may cleave the way for a
system of intercommunication that will
remove a great inconvenience and cause
for dissatisfaction in country homes.
As a first step its importance cannot
be overestimated.</p>

<h3><i>Random Paragraphs</i></h3>

<p>You may say what you please
about Castro, but I glory in his spunk.</p>

<p>President of Venezuela, he was
sitting comfortably in his seat when,
one day, another Venezuelan who
wanted the job cooked up an Insurrection.</p>

<p>South American revolutions, like all
other procedures in civilized communities,
have to be financed.</p>

<p>The question with the leader of the
Venezuelan insurrection was:</p>

<p>“Who will finance <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>The Asphalt Trust stepped forward
with necessary funds.</p>

<p>No doubt the Trust was assured by
Matos, the Insurgent leader, that in
the event his revolution succeeded the
Trust was to have dominion over Venezuela,
like unto that which Standard
Oil has over our own Eden of Christian
Civilization.</p>

<p>At any rate, the Trust put up its
money on Matos, who turned out to
be the wrong horse.</p>

<p>Castro won. But the Trust continued
to help Matos even after he
had lost. Died hard, you see, because
death is not the law of Nature with
Trusts. Usually they live and the
other fellow dies.</p>

<p>The Asphalt Trust is composed, in
part, of American experts in Frenzied
Finance. These marauders who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[Pg 414]</span>
were seeking new worlds to conquer
planned to catch Venezuela in the same
net which holds <i>us</i>.</p>

<p>Castro defied them, fought them in
the Courts, whipped them, took away
the franchise for non-performance of
contract, etc.</p>

<p>Then they had the brazen audacity
to demand that our Government coerce
Castro.</p>

<p>The Trusts rule the United States—shall
little Venezuela check their
career of conquest?</p>

<p>Away with the feeble Castro!</p>

<p>Said the Trust to Roosevelt:</p>

<p>“Shake your big stick at this South
American crank and make him <i>Arbitrate</i>!”</p>

<p>Says Roosevelt to Castro:</p>

<p>“Arbitrate with the Asphalt Trust,
or——”</p>

<p>Says Castro to Roosevelt:</p>

<p>“Arbitrate nothing! Hands off,
or——”</p>

<p>In other words, our Government,
friendly always to Frenzied Finance,
put up a bluff on Castro.</p>

<p>Whereupon Castro stood pat and
“called” Roosevelt.</p>

<p>And, all at once, Mr. Roosevelt went
a-hunting, and left Taft—the portly,
handsome, self-complacent Taft—“sitting
on the lid.”</p>

<p>Bully for you, Castro!</p>

<p>Evidently you are “some punkins.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Would to heaven we had a Castro to
smash the Beef Trust!</p>

<p>Roosevelt and young Garfield don’t
seem to know where to take hold.
The legal proceedings do not advance
half so rapidly as does the price of
beef.</p>

<p>If you have never read Herbert
Casson’s “Organized Self-Help,” do so.

<p>The reason why Sir Plausible Voluble,
of Nebraska, is so mixed up on
the Railroad Question is that his talk-talk-talk
commenced, as usual, before
he understood his subject. At first
he advocated state ownership, which
would have given us forty-odd different
systems. Now he has reached the
point where he wants the Nation to
own national lines of transportation
while the states are to own “local
lines.” <i>Wouldn’t</i> we have a sweet
time deciding which roads are national
and which are local?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Under the present system every line
of transportation has a double character,
partly national and partly local,
and <i>the traffic</i> on every line is partly
state and partly inter-state.</p>

<p>You can no more separate what is
national from what is local in the
railroads than you can in the Post-Office.</p>

<p><i>Every</i> postal route is at once local
and national. A letter may come five
miles, five hundred or five thousand—the
<i>system</i> carries it to its destination.</p>

<p>So with freight and passengers.
The so-called local railroad will carry
freight from the adjoining county,
from the adjoining state, from the
remotest section of the Union, and
from the lands beyond our borders.
So with passengers.</p>

<p>Why, then, should anybody be talking
tommyrot about “<i>local lines</i>”?</p>

<p>Said Betsy Prig to Sairey Gamp, concerning
the alleged existence of a certain
Mrs. Harris, “<i>I don’t believe there
is no sich a person.</i>”</p>

<p>Says I to W. J. B., concerning the
alleged “local lines of transportation,”
I don’t believe there is any such thing
as a local line of transportation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reasoning which sustains government
ownership of a part of the
railroads inevitably leads to the ownership
of all.</p>

<p>At <i>such</i> a cherry, why take two bites?</p>

<p>Why have a system where there is certain
to be a clash between state management
and national management?</p>

<p>Why leave the gaps down for inequalities
in rates?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[Pg 415]</span></p>

<p>Why not insure <i>uniformity</i> by unity
of ownership and management?</p>

<p>Why not learn a lesson from the
German Empire, and avoid state
ownership altogether?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>However, I am glad to see that our
Nebraska friend is making progress.
Give him time, and he will arrive.</p>

<p>For a convert who jumped on our platform
of Government Ownership so recently
as last July, he does fairly well.
But if he would use his thinking apparatus
a little more, and his organs of
speech a little less, he would get on
faster.</p>

<p>“Local lines” of transportation—<i>at
this time</i>?</p>

<p>He might as well say that the artery
in his left hind leg is a “local artery.”</p>

<p>The New York <i>World</i> says:</p>

<p>“If Judge Parker is a Democrat, Mr.
Bryan is not. If Mr. Bryan is a Democrat,
Judge Parker is not.</p>

<p>“No party-name is wide enough to
blanket two such irreconcilable theories
of government.”</p>

<p>That’s where the <i>World</i> falls down.</p>

<p>The Democratic party-name is wide
enough to blanket anything and everything,
anybody and everybody.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it cover the Prohibitionist
and the Saloon-Keeper, the Gold-Bug
and the Free-Silverite, the corporation
lobbyist and the Bible-class expert, the
Free Trader and the Protectionist, the
Bank men and the Anti-Bank men,
the Income Tax men and the Anti-Income
Tax men, the Expansionists
and the Imperialists, the Inflationists
and the Contractionists, strict Constructionists
and those who sent the
United States Army to quell a local
disturbance in Illinois over the protest
of a Democratic Governor.</p>

<p>There is no earthly difference, antagonism,
variance of creed, or policy,
or purpose, or persons that the Democratic
party-name is not “wide enough
to blanket.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Democratic party-name not
wide enough to blanket Judge Parker
and W. J. B.?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, it is.</p>

<p>It did so in 1904, and it will do so
again.</p>

<p>If Bryan whips Parker in the Convention
of 1908, Parkerites will knife
Bryan as they did in 1896 and 1900.</p>

<p>If Parker beats Bryan in the Convention,
Bryan will “come across” in
1908, as he did in 1904.</p>

<p>This play of politics is a very pretty
game, and the politicians get a good
deal out of it.</p>

<p>The people are kept interested and
excited, but the people don’t get anything
out of it.</p>

<p>It is not seriously intended that they
should.</p>

<p>Primarily, the game is played for the
benefit of the players.</p>

meekly following <i>him</i>, Taggart, as he,
the official Commander-in-Chief of the
Democratic Party, bravely leads his
loyal hosts upward and onward.</p>

<h3><i>The Gods We Worship</i></h3>

<p>The savage African, in the wilds of
his native home, takes a few sticks
and some cloth and makes an idol
which he calls Mumbo Jumbo, and before
which he falls prostrate, in devout
worship.</p>

<p>Whereat we civilized fools all laugh
at said African, and call him a barbarian—as
indeed he is.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is quite apparent
that while we make no gods out of
sticks and calico, we worship Mumbo
Jumbos of our own just the same.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the Gold Reserve.
Nature did not produce it; it has no
life, no motion other than that which
we lunatics give it.</p>

<p>One day it occurred to John Sherman
to stack up, in the Treasury, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[Pg 416]</span>
cool hundred million dollars, and keep
it there, idle.</p>

<p>He straightway created the <i>Gold
Reserve</i>.</p>

<p>Any law for this? No.</p>

<p>Any necessity for it? No.</p>

<p>Any popular demand for it? No.</p>

<p>His excuse was that he wanted a
Gold Reserve out of which to pay
off the $346,000,000 in Greenbacks
“when presented for redemption.”</p>

<p>Was anybody clamoring for the redemption
of Greenbacks? No.</p>

<p>Was there any law under which anybody
had a right to go to the Treasury
and demand gold for Greenbacks? No.</p>

<p>Was there any custom or policy
which authorized this setting apart of
gold to redeem Greenbacks? No.</p>

<p>But Sherman did it, just the same,
and it soon appeared that he had
made us a Mumbo Jumbo which we
all worshiped and before whose mysterious
power we all fell prostrate.</p>

<p>As long as Sherman was Secretary
of the Treasury the Gold Reserve was
sacred. Congress looked upon it with
awe. The President did it reverence.
The newspapers bent to it in speechless
adoration. The politicians rubbed the
skin off their stomachs groveling before
it. The people—the great inert mass
within which is irresistible might if
they but had courage and co-operation—patiently
padded their knees and,
likewise, knelt in mute submission.</p>

<p>The Gold Reserve was a national institution—like
the Washington Monument—not
to be desecrated, but recognized,
supported, defended.</p>

<p>Senators alluded to it as they would
to Plymouth Rock or Mount Vernon.
It was a fixed fact which nobody disputed
and all respected.</p>

<p>Statutes referred to it, in passing,
as they did to West Point or Yellowstone
Park—something that was permanent,
national, inseparable from the
life of the Republic.</p>

<p>There never was a law for the Gold
Reserve, there never was a necessity
for it, there never was an antecedent
discussion in regard to it, and there
never was a particle of financial sense
in it. Nobody ever presented Greenbacks
for redemption until Mr. Carlisle
made his infamous ruling, and
gold was paid out for paper and bonds
issued to get the gold back.</p>

<p>The Gold Reserve was useless until
it became, under Carlisle’s ruling, a
bait to set the bond trap with.</p>

<p>To show that it has no influence
upon the value of Greenbacks we need
only to point to the fact that although
the size of the Gold Reserve constantly
fluctuated for about a year after Carlisle’s
ruling, the value of the Greenbacks
has not varied at all.</p>

<p>If the Greenbacks depended on the
Gold Reserve, their value would have
risen and fallen with the Gold Reserve.</p>

<p>The Greenbacks do not, and never
did, depend on the Gold Reserve.
They depend on the credit of the Government,
and the known fact that the
credit of the Government is based on
$80,000,000,000 of national wealth.
Their legal tender quality, their usefulness
as money, their receivability
for taxes and public dues, make them
good in the eyes of the people irrespective
of any Gold Reserve.</p>

<p>John Sherman had no more right to
make a Gold Reserve than he had to
make a Silver Reserve.</p>

<p>Greenbacks were no more redeemable
in gold than they were in silver.
But why argue the case? The verdict
is already made up in the minds
of the jury. Both the old parties pay
their vows to the Gold Reserve.
Mumbo Jumbo is shrined in the hearts
of both Democrats and Republicans.
Sherman’s god rules.</p>

<p>We quake every time they tell us
that anything bad has happened to
the Gold Reserve. We used to toss in
our sleep, muttering distressfully, when
the news would come that the Gold
Reserve “is dwindling.”</p>

<p>What good does Mumbo Jumbo do
the naked African? None.</p>

<p>But then, you see, the African
doesn’t know it. Therein he is a fool.</p>

<p>What good does <i>our</i> Mumbo Jumbo,
the Gold Reserve, do <i>us</i>? None.</p>

<p>But then, you see, we do not know it.</p>

<p>Wherein <i>we are bigger fools than the
African is</i>.</p>

<a name="Poverty" id="Poverty">&nbsp;</a>
<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Poverty</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY JOHN H. GIRDNER, M.D.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I HAVE just read Mr. Robert Hunter’s
book entitled “Poverty.”
It contains much valuable information,
mostly in the form of statistics
and references to other publications
concerning the poor in different
parts of the United States and England.
It is a good book of reference; but to
my mind its principal virtue is as
a thought provoker. The question,
“What are you going to do about poverty?”
stares the reader in the face
from between the lines on every page,
and it haunts him after he has laid the
book aside.</p>

<p>We of the United States are accustomed
to boast of our material wealth
and prosperity. When the writer or
the orator wishes to wring the hearts
of his audience and deceive them into
the belief that ours, as conducted at
present, is the very best of all governments,
he draws a harrowing picture
of the dreadful suffering of the poor of
London; and then we pull the Stars
and Stripes a little more closely about
us, and, as that other Pharisee, we
thank God that we are not like other
men. Before we shed any more tears
over the poor of London let us see if
we cannot find use for our tears nearer
home.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Booth made a thorough
and exhaustive investigation into the
conditions of poverty in London in
1891. He found that 1,300,000, or
about 30 per cent. of the population of
that city were unable to obtain the
necessaries of life. This 30 per cent.
were “living in conditions, if not of
actual misery, at any rate bordering
upon it.”</p>

<p>Mr. B. S. Rountree made a similar
investigation in the typical provincial
town of York, England. He found that
about 28 per cent. of the inhabitants
of York were living in destitution.
Mr. Rountree adds: “We have been
accustomed to look upon the poverty
of London as exceptional, but when the
result of careful investigation shows
that the proportion of poverty in
London is practically equaled in what
may be regarded as a typical provincial
town, we are forced to the startling
probability that from 25 to 30
per cent. of the town populations of
the United Kingdom are living in
poverty.”</p>

<p>Let us turn from England to the
United States, and see how much poverty
there is in our own country, among
our own workmen, or producing class.</p>

<p>The report of the State Board of
Charities for New York State shows
that an average of about 26 per cent.
of the population were aided, by both
private and public charities, during
each of the three years 1897, 1898 and
1899; and according to the report of
the official statistician of the city of
Boston for 1903 more than 20 per
cent. of the entire population of that
city were aided by the public authorities
alone. This does not include private
charities. In fact, all statistics
of charitable works are defective, because
they can never include the efforts
to relieve suffering and poverty
made by those who do not let the left
hand know what the right hand is
doing.</p>

<p>Commenting on the above statistics
from Boston and New York State, Mr.
Hunter says: “If the figures are correct
as published, the persons in New York
State in distress in 1897, and in Boston
in 1903, would equal proportionately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[Pg 418]</span>
the number of those in poverty in
London.”</p>

<p>Here are other facts about poverty
worth remembering: “In the face of
widespread poverty, there have not
been for over half a century in England
so few paupers, either actually
or proportionately, as there are now.
The population of England has increased
from 18,000,000 persons in 1851
to 29,000,000 in 1889. During this
period the number of paupers actually
fell off. London has lost in pauper
population fifteen times as fast as she
has gained in general population.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the returns from
the almshouses in the United States
show that the number of paupers increased
almost as fast as population
during the decade from 1880 to 1890.
In Hartford, Conn., which is said to
be the richest per capita city in the
United States, the number of paupers
increased 50 per cent. during this same
decade.</p>

<p>Now, when you hear a Republican
spellbinder draw harrowing word-pictures
of poverty among the English
workmen, and paint glowing pictures
of the marvelous wealth and happy
condition of the workmen in our own
country, and when you read editorials
in subsidized protectionist newspapers
about the “miseries of the working
classes” in free trade England and the
great prosperity among the highly protected
workmen of the United States,
just remember that according to the
best information obtainable about
twenty-five to thirty persons out of
every hundred living in the towns and
cities <i>both in England and the United
States</i> suffer from poverty. And for
the past forty years poverty has steadily
<i>decreased</i> in England and steadily
and rapidly <i>increased</i> in the United
States. And no amount of ranting by
the spellbinder or misrepresentation by
the editor can alter these facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter is of the opinion that
70,000 New York children go to school
underfed. This statement caused astonishment
and doubt in some quarters.
But I contend that any trained
physician who will note the very
large percentage of anemic faces
among the children as they issue
from the public schoolhouses of this
city will agree with me that Mr.
Hunter’s estimate of 70,000 underfed
children is most likely far below
the mark.</p>

<p>The Children’s Aid Society and
other charitable organizations maintain
a number of industrial schools
for poor children in this city. The
total daily average of children attending
these schools is 10,707. Inspector
Lecktrecker recently made a thorough
investigation into the condition of
these children. Mr. Lecktrecker’s report
goes into great detail. Summed
up, the report shows that of the 10,707
children attending these industrial
schools 8,852 are actually underfed
by reason of poverty at home. It
was found that the best breakfast that
any of these 8,852 children had was a
piece of bread and a cup of tea or
coffee. A diet not only inadequate
for nourishment, but actually destructive
to a child’s nervous system.</p>

<p>A grown-up person only requires
enough nourishment to repair the
waste, wear and tear incident to the
daily activities of brain and muscle.
A child not only requires this, but it
requires added nourishment for the
growth and development of all the
tissues of its body. No wonder we
are raising up a class of people in this
city which I have called in another
place “Newyorkitics.” No wonder
there is an ever-increasing procession
of broken-down brains and nervous
systems heading for the hospitals for
insane. No wonder that crime is on
the increase. What better can be
expected from adults whose brains
and nerves have been starved and
stunted from birth?</p>

<p>But what exactly is poverty? Destitution
of property; indigence; want
of convenient means of subsistence;
need. That is what the dictionary
says poverty is. Want of convenient
means of subsistence is the want of
some one or all of the five chemical
substances called proximate principles,
which we take and must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[Pg 419]</span>
to sustain animal life. The continual
absence of these chemical substances
from the human stomach, together
with lack of clothing sufficient
to protect the body against the elements,
causes physical pain or suffering
with degeneration and final death
of the animal body. This is a literal
scientific definition of the word poverty
as applied to the animal or
material man.</p>

<p>The adulteration of food which is
carried on to such an alarming extent
in the United States is an important
factor in this poverty or underfeeding
question. Even those who are able to
buy a sufficient <i>quantity</i> of food have
no assurance that the <i>quality</i> is such as
will properly nourish their bodies.</p>

<p>When you satisfy the cravings of
hunger by putting into the human
stomach watered milk, or cheese which
is part wax, or sugar mixed with
plaster of Paris, or chocolate which
contains only a suggestion of the rich
cacao beans, or any of the adulterated
articles of food for sale especially in
the poorer sections of the city, you
not only tax the system to digest and
dispose of a quantity of useless and
maybe poisonous material, but every
tissue in the body is thereby robbed
of its proper nourishment.</p>

<p>It is as much, or more, poverty and
underfeeding to fill the stomach with
material which does not contain the
five <i>proximate principles</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, nourishment,
as not to fill it at all. The
laws against substitution and adulteration
of human food and drink
ought to be more stringent than the
laws against horse stealing. Yet, as
I am informed, all efforts at such legislation
are invariably met with the cry
that it will interfere with the <i>business
interests</i> of the country. Here, as in
so many other instances, when an
attempt is made to secure common
justice and protection for the lives and
property and rights of the plain
people, we run up against the <i>business
interests</i>. The curse of this country
today is that everything, even human
life, must be sacrificed when necessary
to the <span class="smcap">business interests</span>.</p>

<p>The industry captains are killing
and maiming the people now just as
the military captains used to do, and
for the same objects—to satisfy greed
and selfishness.</p>

<p>The negro slave in the South in
slavery days was further removed
from poverty and the fear of poverty
than any man I have ever known. When
his day’s work was finished he came
home from the field or the shop and he
found a substantial, well-cooked dinner
awaiting him. After dinner he went
to his comfortable cabin and sat
before a blazing log fire, or, in warm
weather, he sat out under the stars,
fanned by the night winds. His wife
and children were nearly always
around him, as were his companions,
the other slaves belonging to his
master and the plantation.</p>

<p>This man did not have a single care
or responsibility on earth. He did
not have to meet a grinding landlord
next day demanding rent. He did not
have to cudgel his brains to find a
way to meet a note due next week.
He did not have to pay for food,
clothes, light and heat for himself and
his family. That pang of anguish so
familiar to us all when we think of the
possibility of our loved ones suffering
from want and the fear of want when
we are gone never wrung the heart
of that black man. Child labor as it
exists under the present system was
unknown to the children of the black
slaves. “Over the hills to the poor-house,”
when age and decrepitude had
made him no longer useful, had no
terrors for the black slave. The
“system” of slavery made it perfectly
certain that his owner would
provide food, clothes and shelter for
him in his old days, and for his children,
no matter what happened. This
black man, slave as he was, had a
better guarantee against poverty and
the fear of poverty for himself and
family than any life insurance company
can give. Even Mr. Tom Lawson
could not find fault with the
security of this policy.</p>

<p>Another thing the slave father did
not have to worry about was sickness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[Pg 420]</span>
in his family. When one of his children
became ill an ambulance from a
charity hospital did not back up in
front of the negro quarters, cart the
child off to become one patient more in
Ward No. ——, and serve as “material”
for a clinical lecture while it lived,
and as “material” for the dissecting-table
after it was dead. No, nothing
of the kind happened. When the slave
became ill the best medical skill and
nursing were provided, and, if need be,
the patient was taken to the “big
house” where the master lived so the
mistress could superintend the treatment,
and in case of death the body
was put in a neat coffin, and a procession
composed of all the blacks and
whites on the plantation followed the
remains to the colored graveyard on
the hill, burial services were read, a
hymn sung and the body lowered to its
final resting-place. This is a glimpse at
the condition of the slave in life and
death in slavery days. I am not putting
in a brief in favor of chattel slavery.
I was born an abolitionist. My father
was a slave-owner and my early life was
spent in the midst of it, yet I abhorred
the system as a child, and that abhorrence
has grown with years. But I am
now writing about poverty, and my
point is: that chattel slavery as it existed
in the South is the only state of
society I know of in which poverty and
the fear of poverty among the workers
or producing class were absolutely abolished
by law.</p>

<p>Under the old system the negro was
a slave, you say. So he was. But if I
read Mr. Hunter’s book aright, the
laborer under the present industrial
system is also a slave. The laborer
has a vote now and the slave did not.
Yes, but the slave had a full dinner-pail
<i>all the time</i> and the white voting
laborer has not. The comparative
value between his vote and a full dinner-pail
in the mind of the white laborer
under the present system was demonstrated
in the election of 1896 and 1900,
when he gladly gave his vote to the
Republican Party for the <i>mere promise</i>
of a full dinner-pail.</p>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY ALFRED TRESIDDER SHEPPARD<br />
(Copyright in Great Britain by A. T. Sheppard.)</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT nine o’clock Josephine beat a
vigorous reveille on the drum
that had led old troops into
action. It was the second of December;
the sun of Austerlitz shone on the
grass and trees in the little front
white garden, and was fast melting the
delicate tracery of fern and frond on the
oval window of Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum’s
bedroom.</p>

<p>A curious name, Tuck-of-Drum; the
echo of an ancient story told round
camp-fires long burned out; a scrap
of wreckage floating, like its owner,
when the seas of years held so much
that was forgotten. Dominique Laplume
was proud of the name; for even
the village children, whispering “Monsieur
Tuck-of-Drum” behind his back,
brought the flicker of a smile to his
grizzled face and the ghost of a flash
to eyes dim and watery with age.</p>

<p>On Austerlitz day, for many years,
the drum had roused him from his
slumbers. He had slept heavily, this
old warrior; “a thousand thunders!”
he said sometimes in self-excuse,
“when one has made one’s bed as often
on straw or the solid ground——”</p>

<p>His son, growing from childhood to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[Pg 421]</span>
manhood, plied the drumsticks in his
time; he fell at Solferino. His son’s
son held them in his turn; the earth
still lay bare and trampled over him
at Gravelotte. They had given much
to France, these Laplumes. Now Josephine,
with her black sleeves rolled
high on her thin white arms, and her
dimpled face set into desperate earnestness,
took her dead father’s place,
and thundered at the parchment until
the old man’s husky voice answered
the summons.</p>

<p>Her sabots clattered down the stairs.
Coughing and grunting, Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum
began to dress. The clothes
he had worn the day—and many days—before
hung from their pegs in a
chintz-covered recess. On a rush-bottomed
chair near the bed, carefully
brushed and pipeclayed, lay coat, and
belts, and breeches, and gaiters that
had gathered mud, in their time, from
half the kingdoms of Europe. On the
dressing-table the cross of the Legion
of Honor rested in its little leather
case.</p>

<p>At last his shaking fingers opened
the door. The drum lay outside; the
drum, and, on the drum, the gigantic
bearskin, bullet-bitten in old fights,
moth-marked during long, idle years.
He came downstairs in full regimentals.
Madame Laplume was talking
to the village postmaster at the
open door. She ran to meet him.
Her eyes were misty, for she remembered
last year’s reveille; but there
was a ring of gladness in her greeting.</p>

<p>“Good morning, grandfather!” she
cried, kissing him on both cheeks; “a
happy Austerlitz day. There is news,
too——”</p>

<p>“News?” Dying fires flamed up for
a second in his old eyes.</p>

<p>“D’Aurelles de Paladines is driving
them back,” she said. “We won
everywhere yesterday—everywhere.
Chanzy has forced the Bavarians back
on Orgères. We have taken Guillonville,
Terminiers, Monnerville—and—and—where
else, Josephine?”</p>

<p>“Goniers, Villepain, Faverolles,”
little Josephine chimed in, repeating
the names glibly, like a well-conned
lesson.</p>

<p>“And they say the brave General
Duerot has broken out of Paris, and
is marching to join the Army of the
Loire!”</p>

<p>“Good!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum sat down
stiffly, the joints in his long limbs
cracking; he held the coffee-cup to
his lips, but the coffee danced and
splashed out. He jerked the cup
down quickly, and brushed a drop
from his mustache with an impatient
hand.</p>

<p>“It is just as I have said,” he cried
suddenly and fiercely, springing to his
feet. “We have them like trapped
rats! Did I not say so, Héloïse?
Even the little Josephine has heard
me. Listen, Josephine. These Germans,
these enemies of our dear France,
begin to pay for their folly. They
hated us because our great Emperor
led us once to all their capitals—to
Stuttgart, to Dresden, to Munich, to
Berlin—because their kings bowed
hats-in-hand before the soldiers of
France; because we cut up their
country with our swords as I—look
you!—cut this bread of mine.” And
with nervous hands he sliced white,
crust-ringed circles from the roll.
“But now—ah, the Emperor, our
great Emperor, is dead; and the Marshals
and the Grande Armée have
marched away. They found us asleep,
unready; like rats, like locusts, they
swarmed into our cornfields and our
vineyards. But we are awake at last!
We are ready at last! The revenge
begins!”</p>

<p>“It begins,” echoed Madame Laplume.
“But come, grandfather, your
coffee grows cold, and——”</p>

<p>“The punishment begins!” he continued,
his voice shrill as the neigh of
an old war-horse. “Look you!” He
held up a gnarled hand. “Here is
Duerot, with the troops of Paris.
Here”—he raised the other, its knotted
fingers stretched out—“are De Paladines,
Chanzy, De Sonis, Jauréguiberry,
with the Army of the Loire. Now
see; the Germans are between them.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[Pg 422]</span>
He snatched a morsel of the bread he
had been cutting and brought his
palms together. “The Germans—the
Germans——”</p>

<p>“You have cut your hand, grandfather,”
cried Josephine.</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked dumbly at
his palm. A splinter of crust had
grazed the skin. The bread rolled to
the floor.</p>

<p>“They are crushed,” he mumbled,
bringing down his heel. “Miscreants!
that they should dare to enter
France! But they will pay for their
folly; ah, they will pay well! I knew;
I said it. ‘Wait,’ I said, when they
came to us with their long faces and
their stories of defeat. ‘France has
slept; but she will shake herself and
awake.’ <i>Mon Dieu</i>, yes. Why I—I
who speak, my little Josephine, put
a hundred to flight when I was young,
with this little drum alone: that is
why they call great-grandfather Monsieur
Tuck-of-Drum, my dear. See,
it is the sun of Austerlitz that shines
on the white trees. Sixty-five long
years ago—sixty-five long years ago—the
great Emperor pinned this cross
on my breast; ‘Ah, this is Monsieur
Tuck-of-Drum,’ he said, pinching my
ear, ‘who beat the charge in the
village, and put a hundred to flight.’
That was nothing; we did those things.
And again—today—the sun of Austerlitz——”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly as the door
opened and a fat old man, with a large,
hairless, foolish face—the face of a
great baby, still eying the world with
wonder—entered the room. He, too,
wore the uniform of the Emperor’s
Guard. The veterans embraced.</p>

<p>“You have heard the news?” cried
Laplume. “Ah, it is arranged. Austerlitz
day—the day of Austerlitz—sees
victory again for France, my
dear Hippolyte. Sit down, sit down.
Héloïse mixes the salad. Héloïse!
Here is Monsieur Bergeret. It has
been a struggle, my friend, but we
have saved a bottle and a snack for
today; we have arranged it, I say.”
He sniffed, nudged his comrade and
chuckled. A pleasant smell of cooking
already pervaded the sitting-room,
floating in from the kitchen in
the rear.</p>

<p>Madame Laplume, who had vanished
while Dominique was telling the
child of France and its ancient glories,
reappeared, with bare and powdery
arms; Sergeant Hippolyte saluted, and
passed a wavering hand over his foolish
chin. Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum,
talking garrulously all the while, patted
his old comrade’s accoutrements into
shape; fastened a button; untwisted a
red shoulder-knot; rearranged an ill-adjusted
strap. Age was dulling the
Sergeant’s brain a little; “he does
not wear as well as I,” thought Tuck-of-Drum,
with the pathetic pride of
age.</p>

<p>There was a metallic “tap-tap”
and a clatter of sabots on the cobbles
of the village street. “Jacques Dufour
arrives!” cried Dominique Laplume,
and flung the door open with a flourish.</p>

<p>It was like the gathering of ghosts
from the past. It <i>was</i> a gathering
of ghosts from the past. These three,
with their wrinkled cheeks, their
quavering voices, their scanty white
hair, their battered uniforms and
weapons—these three were all that
were left of that band of young recruits
who, in the great days of France,
had marched down the village street,
shouting the songs of the Empire,
blowing kisses to fair faces in the
windows and the roadsides, exchanging
glances with bright eyes that had
grown dim at last and closed on earth
and all its color and glitter. Like
spars, they floated still, scarred and
encrusted by the waves of time that
had engulfed a generation so heroic,
stupendous.</p>

<p>Dufour, wrinkled, wizened, twisted
with rheumatism, limped to his place.
His grandson carried his musket and
placed it in a corner by Bergeret’s;
the old man had lost a limb at Quatre
Bras and needed a stout stick to aid
the wooden leg.</p>

<p>“I will come again at six, grandfather,”
the boy piped shrilly in his
ear. “I say I will come again to
fetch you at six.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[Pg 423]</span></p>

<p>“No, no; Pierre must stay,” interrupted
Monsieur Laplume. “Eh? He
must stay, too, and hear the stories
of the olden days—the days of the
glories of France.” The boy’s eyes lit
up. “Come, we are ready. He shall
sit by the little Josephine.”</p>

<p>By and bye Madame Laplume
brought in the meal, steaming from
the oven. Bottles of red wine were
ranged on the table.</p>

<p>“There were five of us last year,”
Dufour muttered. “Buffet and Deyrolles
have dismissed.”</p>

<p>“Eight the year before,” said Bergeret,
rubbing his hands and smiling
vacuously.</p>

<p>“The ranks grow thin, comrades,”
said Laplume. “Well, the first
toast!”</p>

<p>They rose, and drank in silence to
the memory of that great man whom
they had fought and bled and suffered
for long since—and still remembered
and adored. They drank to the old
Marshals, to the Grande Armée, to
village comrades whose bones lay in
the Peninsula, in Germany, in Belgium,
in the churchyards of France, but
whose faces, dim and mournful, still
looked at them through the mists of
years, and whose voices still echoed in
their memories. They lit cigars and
pipes; but the room was full of the
smoke of ancient battles. They talked
of Desaix, Bessières, Junot, Murat,
Lannes, Masséna, Ney—the old, unforgotten
names. If they could come
again! Ah, if <i>he</i> could come again—how
the scattered remnants of his
lost legions would rally round him,
and young France hurry to the eagles,
and the glorious days return!</p>

<p>“But we are making an end; we are
making an end,” cried Tuck-of-Drum
fiercely, bringing down his fist and
making plates and bottles jump with
the vehemence of the blow. “Chanzy
and Duerot have them in the trap at
last. I said so—did I not? Even the
little Josephine remembers. On the
day of Austerlitz——”</p>

<p>An ominous booming, distant, sullen,
like an echo of old years of strife,
sounded in their ears.</p>

<p>“It is thunder!” cried Pierre. Little
Josephine clutched her mother’s arm.</p>

<p>The veterans exchanged glances.
“What the devil—” began Laplume.
They flung open the door and stepped
into the village street. Two or three
people, white-faced, had stopped to
listen.</p>

<p>The distant guns roared again.
What were they doing there—then—in
that direction? Tuck-of-Drum
looked puzzled, doubtful. This day
of all the year, this great day of his life,
was bound up with all his thoughts; one
hope, one conviction, possessed him,
and had shone steadily through all the
gloom of the last few months. The
day of Austerlitz would see the eagle
turn upon its foes; the sun of Austerlitz
would look down upon the invading
army scattered like chaff before
the wind—crushed, rather, like grain
between the two millstones, the armies
of Paris and the Loire. The previous
day’s successes confirmed him. But
what were the guns doing there? The
fighting should be far beyond Orgères
by this time. He beat down a flicker
of uncertainty.</p>

<p>“Bah, it goes well,” he muttered.
“They make their last stand. Come,
comrades, let us drink to Chanzy and
the Army of the Loire.”</p>

<p>Poor, foolish Bergeret soon fell
asleep, huddled in his chair; but the
wine put fire into the veins of his comrades.
Pierre and Josephine listened
round-eyed as they talked of bivouacs
and camp-fires; of ancient comrades
and conquered cities; of Austerlitz and
the heights of Pratzen, and the Menitz
Lake.</p>

<p>“Sixty-five years ago at this very
hour”—so the talk went on. “Do you
remember? Have you forgotten?”
They argued, they shouted, in their
old voices that broke from gruffness
into shrill quavers, ludicrous under
other circumstances, but now pathetic.
They moved bottles, glasses, salt-cellars,
to illustrate the disposition of
troops; in the blue smoke-clouds the
children, drinking in their words, could
almost catch the glint of the Cuirassiers’
breastplates, the glittering gold-lacing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[Pg 424]</span>
of the Hussars, the rise and fall of green
epaulets as the voltigeurs moved into
line, the yellow facings of Oudinot’s
Grenadiers, the clamorous mêlée of
horse and foot. They discussed the
present fighting, the mistakes of generals;
and here Héloïse, eager as they
for the success of the cause which had
cost her husband’s life, joined in with
the names and dates and figures at her
tongue’s tip. In the distance the
sullen guns were booming.</p>

<p>“If I were with them!” sighed Tuck-of-Drum.
“They had no room for the
old soldier; yet I can beat a charge as
well as ever! I—I who speak, could
fire a musket with the best of them!”</p>

<p>“Grandfather volunteered,” piped
Josephine.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Héloïse, eying the old
man proudly; “but they wanted him to
take care of us. ‘You must look after
the women and children for us, Monsieur
Laplume,’ said the officer. ‘You
have done your share for France in
the field. You know what our great
Emperor wrote, “It will be sufficient
for you to say, ‘I was at the battle
of Austerlitz,’ to authorize the reply,
‘Behold, a brave man.’”’”</p>

<p>Dominique Laplume waved a hand
in depreciation, as if to brush aside
the praise. “A brave man? Every
Frenchman is brave. It is in the blood
of France. We need not be proud of
what we cannot help. We have been
unfortunate, yes; badly led, yes; but
the men—the men——”</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly. The
village postmaster stood again at the
entrance, his eyes starting, his face
lemon-colored, his lips livid under the
straggling beard. “All is lost!” he
cried. “We are betrayed, defeated!
Chanzy is driven back! The enemy
advances!”</p>

<p>The door rattled in the grasp of his
shaking hand. He limped off to spread
the news of the disaster, which grew
with his terror. Laplume, Dufour,
Madame Héloïse, started to their feet
and looked at each other blankly.
The sudden, awe-struck silence woke
Bergeret, who looked round with
wide, foolish eyes. Josephine’s mouth
twitched and tears gathered. Pierre
clenched his brown fists.</p>

<p>“Come,” cried Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum
suddenly. He donned the great
bearskin, the others followed his example,
Bergeret fumbling foolishly with
its heavy chain. His baby face expressed
wonder rather than the alarm,
the bitter disappointment, the wrath,
written on the faces of Madame
Héloïse and Laplume and Dufour.
Tuck-of-Drum girded on his sword and
slung the straps of his drum over his
old bent shoulders. He thrust Bergeret’s
musket into the Sergeant’s
hand. Dufour motioned to Pierre, and
hobbled out; the boy followed him.
Madame Héloïse Laplume ran to the
door to intercept them. “Where are
you going, grandfather? Where are
you going?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Stand back, Héloïse. We go to
call the village. Stay here; stay with
the little Josephine.”</p>

<p>She paused irresolute. After all,
though they could do no good, what
harm could they do—these three old
men? They were going to call the village.
Yet there was a look on the
ancient soldier’s face she had not seen
since the day of the first great reverse,
when he had gone, with his head erect
and old fires flashing in his dim blue
eyes, to offer his feeble services to
France.</p>

<p>Suddenly, loud and distinct above
the distant booming of the guns, his
drum sounded—beating an assembly
in the quiet village street. She put her
hand to her breast and ran out. If the
Germans were really coming——</p>

<p>She clutched his arm.</p>

<p>“Are you mad, grandfather?” she
gasped. “Come in; come in and finish
your wine and pipes together. There
are only boys and women and old men
in the village. They can do nothing——”</p>

<p>He shook her off.</p>

<p>Well, even the enemy, cruel though
they were, could never harm men so
old, so feeble and defenseless. They
would ride through, laughing in their
beards, mouthing their uncouth jokes
at the faded uniforms from which their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[Pg 425]</span>
sires had once fled in terror; but—no,
they would never harm them. Josephine
was crying softly within. She
turned back to the house.</p>

<p>Up the centre of the village street
marched Tuck-of-Drum, drumming,
drumming with an energy surprising
and pathetic, as though he could call
from their weed-grown graves the lads
who had once jumped so smartly to the
rattle of the parchment.</p>

<p>“<i>Rat-a-plan! rat-a-plan!</i>” sounded
the summons; his hands had not lost
their cunning, though they ached and
grew weary with the unwonted strain.
Behind him staggered Bergeret, his
great bearskin toppling forward over the
fat, smooth, foolish face; Dufour hobbled
in the rear, his stick and wooden
leg tapping the cobbles; little Pierre,
beside him, dragged the heavy musket.</p>

<p>Pale faces, working in terror, peered
from the café of the Boule d’Or. Tuck-of-Drum
burst open the door. On the
little tables glasses of bock, tiny glasses
of spirits, stood half emptied. The
men had all risen; the tawdry, gilded
mirrors, cracked and dusty, distorted
their faces, showing them more pallid,
more unhealthy even than in life.
Three or four old men—not so old as
the veterans by many years—three or
four washed-out-looking lads, rejected
even by the army that had dragged
men in from the very highways and
hedges to resist the invaders—turned
startled looks on the newcomers.</p>

<p>“The enemy is coming!” said Tuck-of-Drum.
“Comrades, let us march
against them, like the men of Dreux,
of Châteauneuf! Look—the sun of
Austerlitz is going down! Today, all
France must help——”</p>

<p>They exchanged glances; they huddled
together like sheep.</p>

<p>“What is the use?” one muttered.</p>

<p>“Aye, what is the use?”</p>

<p>A youth sniggered vacuously. “You
are sixty years too late, Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum.
If the great Emperor could
come back now, if France had a man—”
The speaker shrugged his shoulders,
spread out his hands with a gesture of
helplessness and looked round for assent.</p>

<p>“If—if—if!” cried Dominique Laplume.
“<i>We</i> will lead you—we, of the
Grand Army! Today all France must
rise. All must help. It is the great
effort. Today France conquers—or is
conquered. ‘If’ never won a battle.
Come, I say! Jules Brienne, your
grandfather carried an eagle at Marengo.
Monsieur Grenier, your uncle fell
by our side, fighting bravely, on the
field of Austerlitz.”</p>

<p>He argued, ordered, entreated; in
vain.</p>

<p>“Bah! Poltroons!” he muttered, and
turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Again the drum sounded.</p>

<p>“Yes, go out and play with your toy,
Papa Tuck-of-Drum,” cried young Brienne
after him. Laplume did not hear.
They marched next to the Café de l’Ecu.
The village postmaster, shaking still
and casting nervous looks round him
like a frightened horse, was telling his
story to a similar assembly.</p>

<p>“Pah!” muttered old Dufour, twirling
his thin mustache, “these villages
are the rubbish heaps of France. The
men are all away.” Again the appeal
was made. A fat man, with fishy eyes
and yellow, pendulous cheeks, shrugged
his shoulders and raised protesting
hands. “What can we do? What can
we do?”</p>

<p>“They would finish us all with a
volley. We should be killed,” whined
another man.</p>

<p>“Killed? And what then?” Laplume
snorted with fierce contempt.</p>

<p>“Let us be killed then!” broke in
Dufour, crashing his stick down on the
sanded floor. “It would be worth it.
A thousand times worth it! Let each
village in France raise a wall of dead
against the invaders!”</p>

<p>Bergeret nodded his foolish head
again and again with emphasis. The
fat man began to talk fast, volubly, excitedly,
pouring torrents of abuse on
the Emperor, generals, government, the
enemy, waving his fat hands, shrugging
his fat shoulders. The curtained
door of the café opened. He stopped
suddenly and lamely. A countryman
burst in.</p>

<p>“They are coming—they are coming!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[Pg 426]</span>
he shrieked. “I have seen them
in the road. I ran through the woods.
Hundreds of them! I have seen their
lances—the sun on their lances!”</p>

<p>“Come!” cried Dominique Laplume
in a voice of thunder. “In the name of
France!”</p>

<p>No one stirred. He looked round,
scorn in his old eyes. “We will go,
then—Bergeret, Dufour—my old comrades.”
His voice choked with bewilderment,
disappointment, anger.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They went out. The air was sharp
with frost. It was very still in the
village. The sun, a red ball of fire, still
glowed on the frosted trees; on the
white and yellow walls of the cottages;
on the white fields and white-cowled
windmills; on the powdered cobbles
of the street. A segment of moon,
strangely like a pierrot head, thrust
through curtains of cloud, its mouth
whimsically awry, peered down sideways
at the earth—at the white earth,
where legions of tiny men, like ants,
hurried to kill or be killed in their bewildering
quarrels. The distances were
blue—the shimmering steel-blue of winter
distances. Here and there a column
of black smoke, shot through again
and again with tongues of fire, went up
to heaven; the smoke of burning villages;
little sacrifices France offered for
her folly to gods not yet appeased.</p>

<p>“To the bridge,” said Tuck-of-Drum.
They marched in silence.
The drum was silent. At the end of
the long, straggling street a tiny
bridge spanned a frozen stream which
the enemy must cross. By the side
of it was a clump of bushes, so thick
that, even leafless, they formed a
screen behind which the veterans and
the boy crouched down.</p>

<p>“They might have broken down the
bridge at least,” grumbled Dufour.
“Menitz was frozen, and the Emperor——”</p>

<p>“They are coming!” whispered
Pierre.</p>

<p>His sharp ears, close to the ground,
had caught the <i>clip-clop</i> of approaching
hoofs.</p>

<p>Tuck-of-Drum drew his sword and
rested its hilt on the rough wooden
parapet of the bridge. “Fix bayonets!”
he growled.</p>

<p>Sergeant Bergeret should have given
the word, but he carried out the order
placidly, drawing the sword from its
scabbard and fixing it with his fumbling
fingers. “Put it in for me,”
muttered Dufour, handing his bayonet
to Pierre. “Now give me the musket—so—and
run home, good lad. Embrace
me and then run home.”</p>

<p>He sat on the ground, his wooden
leg stiff and straight in front of him,
and clutched the bayonet. Pierre’s
lips tightened; he did not move. “Go
home, I say!”</p>

<p>“Hush, they come!” whispered Tuck-of-Drum.</p>

<p>Peering through the brushwood,
they could see, on the road ahead, the
pennoned lances of German Uhlans,
rising and falling with the jolting of
the horses. The hoofs clicked louder
and louder on the frozen road.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tuck-of-Drum sprang up.</p>

<p>“The Guard will advance,” he
growled, with a little hoarse laugh,
the faint echo of one that men now
dead had heard and talked of, long
since. Joy, fierce, savage joy of fighting,
dormant so long but not extinct,
flared up and flashed in his faded eyes.
And yet, with the joy, a rage terrible
and righteous shook him as he saw
the glitter of the steel, the fluttering
pennons, the casques and foreign uniforms—the
foes of France, violating
the sacred soil of which the dust of his
race had made.</p>

<p>His trembling hands clutching the
drumsticks, he advanced to the centre
of the bridge. Bergeret stood on his
right, his bayonet extended. Dufour
grasped the parapet, dragged himself
up, groaning in spite of clenched
teeth, planted his wooden leg firmly,
and, leaning against the woodwork
of the bridge, rested the butt of his
weapon on the ground, the tremulous
steel pointed toward the enemy.
Pierre came to help him. “Go back!
go back!” he growled, pushing the boy
aside with all his feeble strength.
Pierre slipped on the frozen earth and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[Pg 427]</span>
fell, clutching at the bushes. Suddenly
Dominique Laplume sounded the
<i>pas de charge</i>.</p>

<p>A strange, pitiful defiance this,
echoing back through the deserted
village street, floating mournfully out
to the white, empty fields, sending its
arrogant, useless challenge to the ribbon
of white road ahead. “<i>Rat-a-plan!
rat-a-plan!</i>” The old drum, that
had sent a hundred men flocking like
sheep before it—the old drum that
Jules, who fell at Solferino, that
Dominique, who fell at Gravelotte, had
beaten on winter mornings of their
boyhood—answered nobly to this last
great effort, and seemed a living,
sentient thing, entering into the brave
spirit of the challenge.</p>

<p>There was a startled shout, a clatter
of stones, as the Uhlans reined in their
horses.</p>

<p>“They fly!” shrieked Tuck-of-Drum;
“they—ah!”</p>

<p>Half a dozen carbines shot up and
flashed fire. There was a hoarse cry
in German; an officer struck aside the
stock of a man’s weapon.</p>

<p>Dufour’s bayonet clattered down;
he slid into the thicket, his wooden leg
scoring a long, jagged line in the frosty
road. Bergeret was on his knees, a
light of strange intelligence dawning
in his smooth, foolish face; quite
suddenly he fell sideways on to his
fallen bearskin, matted already with
his blood.</p>

<p>Tuck-of-Drum still stood in the
centre of the bridge. The drumsticks
descended on a drum pierced
and soundless—then dropped, one
after the other, slowly, from his nerveless
grasp. The world swung around
him. The poplars down the roadway
on which his glazing eyes were fixed
marched, doubled, moved into echelon
and square. “<i>La Grande Armée! La
Grande Armée!</i>”</p>

<p>Was it the cry of the Germans, in
wonder, in derision, in pity? Or did
his quivering lips frame the words?
Ghosts formed round him; the ghosts
of the old battalions who had marched,
long back, into silence. They swayed,
they heaved, in countless numbers; file
after file, rank after rank, regiment
after regiment, formed up, doubled into
place, and passed him by. He saw
the flash of breastplates, the crimson
fronts of the Polish lancers, the red
plumes of the line, the bearskins of
the Guards, the glittering eagles of
France.</p>

<p>“My comrades—O my comrades!”
He staggered forward, with stretched-out
hands. A confused murmur
buzzed in his ears; it swelled into a
tumult—“<i>and the shout of a king was
among them</i>.”</p>

<p>One hand sought the bearskin.
Suddenly he fell face forward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Under the wide sky, in the uniform
of their dead Emperor, the three veterans
lay together; a young boy
crouched near them, bleeding from an
unnoticed wound, and sobbing.</p>

<p>A night wind crept over the frozen
fields; a little wind, like a sigh from
France for her ruined homes, her
smoking villages, her slain children,
her lost cause and faded glories.</p>

<p>The sun of Austerlitz sank down
behind the poplars.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Southern Negro as a Property-Owner</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY LEONORA BECK ELLIS</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BETWEEN the Southern negro as
property and the Southern negro
as a property-owner worthy
of account, American progress has set
its milestones thick and strongly
marked. Yet, as mere years go, the
time has been short indeed for a
transition of meanings so vast.</p>

<p>The act of emancipation brought in
its train several very serious problems,
and more than one of these must be
acknowledged to have grown graver
with further-reaching complexities and
involutions as the decades have passed.
But in the present article these are not
under consideration.</p>

<p>The point we desire to emphasize is
that one of the most difficult questions
brought to issue in the emancipation of
the negro has already solved itself by
what we are accustomed to call natural
processes.</p>

<p>When the epochal pen-stroke fell
and $3,000,000,000 worth of Southern
property was suddenly obliterated as
property, yet stood there in plain
world’s view, like the metamorphosed
dragon’s teeth, as men with the rights
of men, there were masters of statecraft
everywhere who faced one another
blankly, asking how such a situation
was to resolve itself. Not even the
most sanguine saw any reason to hope
that so complex an issue as that involved
in the relation of the freedmen
to the land could be brought to satisfactory
or righteous solution until at
least three or four generations had
mingled dust with dust.</p>

<p>The relation of the freedmen to the
soil! Here was the problem that must
have given pause to an older state, a
European nation, say, upon the eve
of liberating at one stroke four millions
of serfs.</p>

<p>But young nations, like young individuals,
often let their deep convictions
sweep them unprepared into strange
conditions and perils, from which only
the magnificent vitality of youth rescues
them without disaster.</p>

<p>The United States Government has,
for half a dozen years past, recognized
it as a duty to compile and offer for
public reading certain facts and figures
relating to the progress of the negro in
acquiring education, following different
pursuits and trades, and accumulating
property. Out of the various reports
upon these subjects issued from the Department
of Labor since 1897 it is
probably the information set forth regarding
the property-holdings of the
former slaves and slaves’ children in
three or four Southern states that will
strike the greatest number of people
with surprise, even with that form of
astonishment which borders on unbelief.
Yet this surprise is of the healthful
type, and the unbelief passes when
a closer investigation is made into the
matter.</p>

<p>The closer investigation is undoubtedly
worth while, and it will prove
profitable for a little while to exchange
general statements and sweeping surveys
for definite figures, well verified
data and typical cases within a limited
territory.</p>

<p>Therefore, to illustrate clearly that
particular phase of the negro’s progress,
the adjustment of his relations to the
land and his steadily advancing gains
in real estate and other property-holdings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[Pg 429]</span>
it will serve best to take the state
of Georgia and present certain comparative
data relating to the situation
here.</p>

<p>Our choice of the commonwealth of
Georgia for the setting forth of this
matter, instead of some sister state,
can be easily justified. Although the
youngest of the original thirteen states,
and the only one whose early constitution
barred slavery from its boundaries,
yet, when the Civil War came on Georgia
had long been a slave state of great
importance, and at once took a leading
part in the struggle. Her people suffered
heavier losses from the war, it
is authoritatively claimed, than those
of any other state except Virginia,
the old order of things being more
utterly wrecked and old landmarks
more completely effaced here than
elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are other reasons for our
choice less disputable even than these.
Georgia has the largest area of any
state east of the Mississippi River,
and, in her great sweep of 59,475 square
miles, from the Appalachian Mountains
to the Atlantic Ocean, exhibits
the greatest diversity of soil, climate
and physical features, all of which must
be conceded to affect negro life and industry.
Lying largely in the so-called
“Black Belt,” the state still presents
quite as marked a diversity of social
conditions as of physical, nor have any
of the former slave-holding states been
more strongly affected than this by the
industrial and educational movements
which have stirred the South within
the last few years. It is only fair to
call attention, likewise, to the fact that,
while Georgia is recognized as the centre
of some of the most radical thought
and action upon the negro question,
yet this condition is counterbalanced
by the existence within its borders of a
mass of white voters who seem more
than ordinarily swayed by an intense
sense of justice to the black. Witness
the manner in which all bills tending
toward negro disfranchisement meet
summary defeat before the Georgia
Legislature, and, again, the defeat of
the last year’s movement to divide the
state’s educational funds in such a way
as to allow to colored schools only the
pro rata share representing taxes on
the property of the negro.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it may be added here,
that while the state has no Hampton
or Tuskeegee within her borders, still
she has most excellent public schools
for negroes, and in several cities she is
now giving them admirable training in
manual and industrial arts along with
the academic studies, as, notably, at
Columbus; and she also has an important
branch of her state university
devoted to the industrial, technical
and manual training of colored youths—that
is, the Industrial College for
Negroes at Savannah, a high-grade
institution wholly supported by public
funds.</p>

<p>If the selection of Georgia for a local
study of the negro’s material progress
does not yet appear justified, then the
last, and in itself wholly adequate,
reason may now be assigned, namely,
that the state has the largest negro
population of any in the Union, her
colored people numbering 1,034,998, or
a bare trifle under 50 per cent. of the
entire population. Observe that in
this state are congregated more than
one-eighth as many blacks as are scattered
throughout the remaining half a
hundred states and territories of the
Union.</p>

<p>New Year’s Day of 1863 saw 470,000
freedmen in Georgia, these in the main
having been ushered into liberty in
quite as destitute a condition, regarding
land and other worldly possessions,
as that in which they were ushered
into existence. The exceptions
to this generally prevalent destitution
were favored slaves here and there
whose former masters and mistresses,
too often nearly destitute themselves,
had deeded them little homesteads, or
in some other way given them a start
in independence. Or, again, there
were exceptions in the case of the few
thousands upon whom General Sherman
and his associates had bestowed
certain donatives in the shape of
wages, usually unearned, and bounty
money or lands, all distributed with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[Pg 430]</span>
the injudiciousness expected in such
a situation.</p>

<p>Today, barely one generation’s space
removed from that hour of strange
and sorrowful conditions, these freedmen
and their children pay taxes on
more than a million acres of Georgia
land, not to mention houses, household
goods, stock, agricultural implements,
merchandise and other taxable properties.
If the situation speaks well for
American life and opportunities, it also
speaks well for the black man, and
more eloquently still for his chances in
the South.</p>

<p>The toilsome processes by which the
Georgia negro has climbed from destitution
to his present state of comparative
prosperity deserve more than a
passing glance. Do not think it was
the same as if you or your neighbor,
or even Mr. Riis’s European, who is to
be refashioned into an American,
should start today without money or
lands, without friends except those
destitute as yourselves. We should
know where to turn, what work to take
up, how to apply whatever of skill or
energy or special aptitudes might exist
within us. Failing of skill or marked
aptitudes of our own, failing even of
an ordinarily good education, we should
at least have within us inherited instincts
to help us out of the difficult
situation. Above all, we should know
what was in the world, what was worth
striving for, where to set our aims.</p>

<p>But what of skill did the negro have,
save in the rudimentary forms of agriculture?
Whither, save for restraining
influences, would his inherited instincts
have led him? What did he
know of life experientially beyond the
log square of a slave’s cabin, or by observation
and hearsay beyond the compass
of the plantation lord’s domain?</p>

<p>No; set it down that the new freedman
was poorer than the poorest, and,
except in rare cases, more ignorant
than can now be readily conceived of.
In such condition, with no higher aims
to impel him to work than the bare
instinct of self-preservation, his work
must of necessity be for many years
only a bread-meat-and-shelter matter.</p>

<p>Yet, somehow—who can tell by
what strange evolution?—working on
blindly, gropingly, toilsomely, he has
still contrived to press forward, until
today, with a generation scarcely gone,
he stands on a plane no one counted
on his reaching under a hundred years.
And the best of all his gains is that
the most intelligent of his race have
come to comprehend what true progress
means, and to compare the slight
space traversed by their people with
the vast upward stretch reaching away
in front of them.</p>

<p>During one of the large conventions
which recently met in a Georgia city,
a visitor from New England asked me,
with genuine concern: “But where do
your better class negroes live? Or
are there no blacks decently housed,
no places at least approximately clean
and comfortable that they can claim
as homes? In various cities through
your section I have found only swarming
and fetid negro quarters, the worst
of slums, a menace to municipal
health, both physical and moral. Is
there nothing more hopeful than this
to show for the race?”</p>

<p>Admitting the general truth of his
imputation, I was still able to point
out to him a few streets, or sections of
streets, where the most intelligent and
prosperous of the blacks of the city
had made themselves real homes. Yet
even these, he demurred, bordered too
close upon those same slums he had
been fretting over. For in Southern
cities the people of this race keep together,
it will be noted.</p>

<p>But I told my guest to come with
me to the country if he would see the
negro at his racial best. Agriculture,
I assured him, had come very near to
spelling out salvation for this people.
Instance the state conference of colored
farmers convening not so very
long ago in Savannah. Nearly two
hundred delegates were present, and
everyone owned his own home, many
being comparatively wealthy. One in
particular was pointed out as worth
$50,000, made entirely from agriculture.</p>

<p>In the country, then, we must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[Pg 431]</span>
still look for the best average of the
negro’s home, his domestic life and
virtues, as well as his industry and
thrift. A brief investigation of conditions
brought our New England
friend to the same conclusion, and he
went away much better satisfied as to
the prospects of the race.</p>

<p>Certain facts and figures which interested
this intelligent student of
racial conditions will doubtless interest
scores of others, and they are,
therefore, offered in the present
paper.</p>

<p>Georgia has 137 counties, each constituting
a small commonwealth in
itself. Being settled at irregular periods
and under diverse circumstances,
varying, moreover, in topography and
character of the soil and climate, these
counties exhibit each a different ratio
of the negroes to the whites.</p>

<p>A glance at the maps may aid in
forming a clear idea of the movements
and growth of the black population in
Georgia. In 1790, it will be observed,
the counties near the coast
were the only ones settled, and if the
black folk were inconsiderable in numbers,
so were the white.</p>

<p>But by 1800 the slaves were showing
a rapid increase, and were being
moved up the Savannah River, while
from that time to 1840 the population,
both white and black, exhibited a
marked tendency to seek the rich
lands of the interior, pushing westward
and, a little later, southwestward.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1900 the
blacks of the state had increased
from the few thousands of slaves of a
century back, held chiefly on the
coast, to more than a million free
people, fairly well dispersed through
all but the extreme mountain counties
and paying taxes on many million
dollars of Georgia property.</p>

<p>From the office of the comptroller-general
of the state there is issued
annually a full report of the property-holdings
of both blacks and whites,
set forth with exactness of detail
county by county. From the file of
these reports it is easy to make a comparative
study, in brief or at length,
of past changes, progress or retrogression,
and the present status in
any or all of the Georgia counties.
But the general reader will be able to
draw his conclusions from a glance at
a few of these.</p>

<p>Chatham County, the original seat
of settlement, is perhaps the best
starting-point. It is located in Southeastern
Georgia, washed by the Savannah
River and the tides of the Atlantic,
has for its county seat Savannah, the
second city of the state, and comprises
mainly a stretch of marshland,
low islands and flat, sandy tracts. In
early days a brisk slave trade brought
many negroes to this county, and since
the war the city of Savannah has
attracted the freedmen in great numbers.
The relations between whites
and blacks have been more uniformly
cordial here than elsewhere, the former
being in the main of the original
slave-holding class, and the latter
largely house servants. The situation
is thus in direct contrast to that in
Atlanta, for instance. By the year
1790 there were already 8,313 blacks
in Chatham County, as against 2,456
whites; while the census of a hundred
years later shows an increase to
54,757 negroes and 22,966 whites.</p>

<p>Sherman’s celebrated field order,
issued immediately after his investment
of Savannah, gave hundreds of
former slaves temporary possession
of valuable lands on the coast and
sea islands of this county, as it did
to a lesser extent in certain other
sections of the state. This tenure
was in some cases brief, but in many
others became permanent. Hence,
even as early as 1875, we find the
freedmen owning 1,491 acres of Chatham’s
land, valued at upward of
$70,000, besides town and city realty
worth $152,760. Twenty-five years
later they had multiplied these figures
by four, approximately. No bad showing,
when all things are taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>Another coast county, Liberty, is
beyond doubt the most interesting in
its history of all the so-called “black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[Pg 432]</span>
counties.” This, too, is located in the
southeastern portion of Georgia, a
neighbor of Chatham’s, with much
the same climate and topographical
features, and was laid out in 1777.
But the history of its first settlers deserves
to be traced much further back,
for, in 1695, there had come to South
Carolina a little colony of New England
Puritans, breaking off from the parent
church at Dorchester, Mass., and led
by Joseph Soul, a Harvard graduate
and teacher. Their location in South
Carolina having proved unhealthful,
they were attracted by Oglethorpe’s
little Georgia settlement, and, having
secured a grant of 32,000 acres on the
present site of Liberty County, they
removed thither in 1752, their colony
then numbering 280 whites and 536
negro slaves! The county was laid
off as Midway, but later changed its
name to Liberty. It should be remarked
that when secession from the
Union became an issue this county
voted solidly against it.</p>

<p>After the Civil War the land here
was thrown largely on the market, and
at several places, notably Woodville,
Ogeechee and Belmont, numbers of
negroes united themselves into colonies
and bought extensive tracts. There
are now in the county nearly ten
thousand negroes, with half that
number of whites; and the former own
more than 50,000 acres of land.</p>

<p>Appling is a county also in the southeastern
portion of the state, but presenting
a very different showing. It is
a level county, inland, with poor soil,
and the tide of slaves poured around
it without touching it. In 1820 there
were just eighty-six negroes within its
borders. When manumission came
there were only about seven hundred
Appling County slaves to be set free.
At the present time it is estimated
that there are 3,000 negroes in the
county, with more than twice that
number of whites. But from the
comptroller-general’s latest report it
appears that the former own 17,946
acres of land, such land as it is!</p>

<p>Now run up to Central Georgia.
Here is found the flourishing city of
Macon, in the county of Bibb. The
census of 1890 gave Macon a population
of 22,746, of whom one-half were
negroes. The land in this section is
hilly, with soil mixed, good and bad.
Twenty-five years ago there were something
over 11,000 negroes in the county,
outnumbering the whites by nearly
two thousand, and they owned 2,611
acres of land. Now the blacks have a
trifle more than doubled in numbers,
as well as in property-holdings. Observe,
too, the higher value of the
negro’s farm lands in this section.
His 4,500 acres of Bibb County land is
now assessed at $413,300, which
amount, added to his town and city
realty and other taxable properties,
makes an aggregate value of $719,380
in this county alone.</p>

<p>A little to the northeast of Bibb
County lies Baldwin, of which Milledgeville,
the former state capital, is the
chief town. This was a very wealthy
ante-bellum section, with large holdings
in slaves as well as lands. When
the Civil War began Baldwin County
could muster 5,000 slaves, although of
the whites, rich and poor, there were
only 4,000. When the census of 1890
was taken the negroes had increased
to 9,343, the whites only to 5,262.
Last year the negroes were paying
taxes on 6,501 acres of Baldwin County
land, valued at $26,599, besides a
large amount of city and town property
and other possessions, the whole
aggregating $104,592.</p>

<p>Take another county in Middle
Georgia, a county of good lands but
without a town of any size in it, therefore
representing more nearly a plain
agricultural average. Any one of a
score might be selected. Let us say
Butts, a small but prosperous county
which was laid out in 1825 and at the
outbreak of the war had 3,082 slaves
and 3,375 whites. A quarter of a century
ago its freedmen, numbering
approximately 4,000 people, owned
but ninety-seven acres of land in the
entire county and $350 worth of town
property. Have they climbed since
1875? In numbers they are now estimated
at 7,000, against a like number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[Pg 433]</span>
of whites, and last year these negroes
paid taxes on 1,613 acres of good average
farming land, and on other property
which ran the total valuation in
Butts up to $49,941.</p>

<p>In the mountain counties of Georgia
it has been different, the increase in
number of negroes as well as their possessions
being slow and uncertain,
while the whites have maintained a
steady progress in such sections. This,
however, is clearly accounted for by
the lesser ratio the agricultural interests
bear to others in mountainous
districts, and the dependence of the
negroes upon the former. Glance at
Gilmer County, with its sixty-nine
blacks and almost 10,000 whites, the
former paying taxes on a few hundred
acres of rocky hillsides, and their
whole county property aggregating, by
the most recent returns, only $957,
while the latter show taxable possessions
valued at $728,000. In Rabun,
Towns, Flannin and neighboring
counties the situation shows much the
same.</p>

<p>This brief study of typical counties
may be closed with certain comparative
data from Fulton, which contains
the state’s capital, Atlanta, a progressive
and rapidly growing city distinctly
of the “New South” type. Fulton was
not laid out until 1853, hence is relatively
young in the sisterhood of counties.
Only about 2,000 slaves were set
free in this county. Compare the number
with the 16,000 manumitted in
Chatham. But today there are more
than 50,000 negroes in Fulton, and,
although they own but a thousand
acres of land in the county, yet the
aggregate value of their whole property
is a bare trifle below one million
dollars!</p>

<p>To extract the most important meanings
from such figures is not difficult.
In connection with them several facts
should be kept in mind, the first of
which is that the negro’s land-holdings
in Georgia as well as in adjoining states
are usually parceled out in very small
individual lots. In a canvass of fifty-six
typical counties of the state, the
following table was established to show
the average size of the farm lots among
negro proprietors:</p>

<table summary=" " cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

      <td class="tdl">500 acres or over</td>
      <td class="tdr_ws1">.93</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The fifty-six counties canvassed represent
the majority of negro holdings in
the state, and the average here established
may fairly be taken as that of the
state at large, or, indeed, of the agricultural
South. The fact that a very large
proportion of the farms are so limited
in size as to amount only to gardens, or,
in negro parlance, “patches,” augurs
well rather than ill, for it means many
small proprietors instead of merely a
few large ones and the rest all renters
or day laborers. Since out of 369,265
black people in the state ten years of
age or over who are engaged in gainful
occupations, almost two-thirds are
employed in some line of agricultural
work, is it not well that the million
acres owned by negroes should be distributed
in small holdings? It is easy
to deduce from this the manifest decline
of the metayer, or tenant system
of farming. To be sure, these one-acre,
or even ten-acre farms will seldom
support the owner, though he may have
the smallest family, or none at all.
Such farms are largely instances of
what may be called, in the German
phrase, <i>Parzellenbetriebe</i>—that is, farms
not large enough to occupy the labor
of a family, but serving as sources of
partial support to those with supplementary
occupations. Yet, in many
cases, these little plots of ground will
grow to goodly farms within a few
years. The same story has been
traced a thousand times in the past
quarter of a century.</p>

<p>It will be remarked, also, that the
negro’s town and city property is increasing
greatly. In 1880 the assessed
value of such property was only
$1,201,992, or 20 per cent. of their entire
state property; while in 1902 it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[Pg 434]</span>
$4,389,422, which is close to 29 per cent.
of the state’s aggregate. Thus, while
agriculture gave the freedman his start
in self-maintenance, and is still his
chief dependence, yet paths of employment
and sources of revenue in cities
are being discovered by him more and
more as the years go by and his education
progresses.</p>

<p>Before passing to the close, another
point is worthy of especial note, interesting
both the economist and the
sociologist. In 1875 the assessed value
of the household and kitchen furniture
owned by all the negroes in the state,
then numbering between six and seven
million souls, was only $21,186, or something
like three cents’ worth to each
individual. But in 1902 the assessed
value of the same class of property
was $1,688,541, or a trifle over the
value of a dollar and a half to each
colored man, woman and child in the
state. Upon this phase of development
and progress no comment is
needed.</p>

<p>In brief, then, the black people of
Georgia paid taxes for 1902 on 1,175,291
acres of land, and upon an entire
property aggregating $15,188,069 in
assessed value. This means, beyond
the shadow of a doubt, that the negroes
of Georgia, or, broadly speaking,
the South, are accumulating property
and acquiring homes. And since the
negro with a home is almost sure to
stand for law, order and civic faithfulness,
it means, moreover, a reaching
out toward higher standards of living,
not material living alone, but social life,
mental and moral striving and achievements.</p>

<p>Comprehending the situation in its
fulness, no man can deny that the race
is actually <i>started</i> on the road to better
things than their past might have indicated
that they were capable of attaining.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>A Japanese Populist</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY THOMAS C. HUTTEN<br />
<i>Author of “National Characteristics,” “The Farthest East”</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO years ago a prominent Russian
patriot admitted a misgiving
that nothing but a miracle
could shake the strongholds of Czarish
despotism. It does not impeach the
correctness of his view that the miracle
has been accomplished.</p>

<p>A giant has entered the political
arena; a new world power has risen
from the dust of a Buddhist serf-kennel,
and it is about time to recognize
the fact that the marvel of evolution
has been effected by progress in the
direction of popular democracy.</p>

<p>The memorable vote of the daimios
was a renunciation of class privileges.
Of the forty amendments in the new
constitution of the Japanese Empire,
twenty-six tend to reform the abuses
of class legislation. The nation controls
two-thirds of its mines. Stockholders
of a telegraph monopoly have
been forced to accept a time limit
of their contract. Six hundred and
twenty miles of railroads are managed—and
successfully managed—by a national
board of administration. The
Government, in the name of the nation,
builds its own warships and welds its
own armor-plates, instead of farming
out jobs to the highest briber. The
Ways and Means Committee of 1901
reduced direct taxation almost on the
exact plan of the system recommended
by the reformer Bakunin—reserving
building lots in new cities and granting
tenures from two to ten years at gradually
increasing rates of rent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[Pg 435]</span></p>

<p>Populist reforms have rendered the
Government popular enough to make
the nation invincible.</p>

<p>And the world-wide need of those
reforms has been repeatedly urged by
Japanese travelers, and with the emphasis
of strong personal conviction,
especially by a keen observer who visited
Europe and North America in the
summer of 1903.</p>

<p>Professor Yashinto Korioky, agent of
a Tokio reform club, explored the United
States without the assistance of the
guides trained by our Star-spangled
Uncle and with often remarkable results.</p>

<p>“Surprises,” he says, “indeed, began
before we had set foot on the soil of
the great moral Republic. Above the
sea mist and above the gathering clouds
a fire gleamed like a meteor on the
western horizon, and one of the Chinese
steerage passengers, venturing to
inquire, ascertained that it was a statue
of liberty, furnishing light to the world.
The next moment a sailor struck him
between the eyes, and he admitted
that he saw several starlike, luminous
objects.”</p>

<h3>A TEST OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</h3>

<p>“The next morning,” he continues,
“I got my traveling scrip, but was informed
that our boat was moored on
the wharf of an island, where immigrants
are assorted according to the
degree of their rectitude. Some pass
the ordeal of scrutiny with ease, others
with difficulty, for reasons which I was
not always able to discern. I noticed,
however, that the Government has
coined shekels of silver with inscriptions
expressing sentiments of virtue—“In
God we trust,” or similar words—and
whenever a traveler came provided
with a goodly number of these
tokens, his righteousness seemed to be
taken for granted.”</p>

<h3>PATERNAL SOLICITUDE</h3>

<p>“The investigations of the learned
officials in some cases extended to articles
of wearing apparel. One Canton
trader had underlined his tunic with
eighty yards of fine silk, which, being
discovered, were unwound and confiscated
to enforce a lesson of modesty
in the matter of dress.”</p>

<h3>WORLDLINESS SUPPRESSED</h3>

<p>“He was, however, allowed to proceed,
more fortunate than two of his
countrymen who had crossed the ocean
for the first time, and were sent
back at the expense of the Chinese
contractors. Forty years ago these
worldly toilers were admitted as freely
as other foreigners; but it was noticed
that they worked sixteen hours a day
and seven days in the week, thus disregarding
the duty of providing leisure
for spiritual exercises. And as their
lack of repentance was, moreover, aggravated
by the rapid accumulation of
coin, it was finally decided to remove
them for the promotion of their higher
interests.”</p>

<h3>A SCHOOL OF PATIENCE</h3>

<p>“Animals that are most carefully excluded
from the residence quarters of
Japanese towns enjoy the freedom of
many American cities. Cats roam at
large and dogs are permitted to defile
public monuments.... After
dark their clamor exceeds the vociferations
of the East Indian jackals and
robs thousands of sleep; but it is perhaps
necessary that taxpaying citizens
should be trained in lessons of
self-denial.”</p>

<h3>GOVERNMENT MAN-TRAPS</h3>

<p>“Knowing my reputation for veracity,
be prompt, my brother, to intercede
if the unregenerate of your neighborhood
should question the following
facts: In the course of each year some
80,000,000 ox-loads of grain are manufactured
into a health-destroying poison;
... coal stoves, pretty as the
vases of Nagasaki, radiate warmth in
winter; fans, operated by unseen forces,
mitigate the heat of the summer season.
Singers often warble with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[Pg 436]</span>
skill of the sirens. In the neighborhood
of these seductive traps the Government
then posts its man-catchers
and awaits results. It may seem incredible.
But I have been informed
that in Southern China monkeys are
often captured by similar devices.
When the poison begins to operate they
fall bewildered, and their awakening in
a cage the next morning must tend to
mitigate the frivolity of their disposition.”</p>

<h3>A THOUGHTFUL LANDLORD</h3>

<p>“The owner of the estate, we ascertained,
was a timber merchant, as well
as a pillar of virtue, and a large number
of trees in the rear of the building
had recently been felled—probably to
give the neighborhood a more unobstructed
view of heaven.”</p>

<h3>COMPENSATING LEGISLATION</h3>

<p>“Those stock gamblers, whose conspiracies
had ruined thousands, were
not mistaken in their expectation that
the law would protect them against
the risk of a riot. Children, gambling
for peanuts, are promptly arrested.
The advantages of magisterial virtue
cannot be overrated.”</p>

<h3>FOUR-HANDED FILIPINOS</h3>

<p>“Apes, almost as dissolute as sparrows,
are exhibited in the parks of
several American cities.... In
the Philippine Islands a large number
of these animals has recently been
captured and caged—probably to limit
their opportunity for worldly enjoyments.”</p>

<h3>NEMESIS</h3>

<p>“But we learned that the steam
launch scudding along the west shore
of the bay was a smuggler, and its
pursuer a Government revenue tug.
For weeks—perhaps for months—the
contrabandists, of Canadian origin,
had been selling meat at frivolous
rates, and the avengers of sacrilege
were now at their heels.”</p>

<h3>JUVENILE DEPRAVITY</h3>

<p>“From the window of one of these
air-trains, a package came clattering
down on the sidewalk, scattering a
shower of biscuits and hard-boiled
eggs which were seized and devoured
by the children of poverty before the
guardians of law and order could interfere.
One youngster of five or six
years captured a piece of fruit cake
and took to his heels with whoops
of unregenerate glee, whereupon two
older boys raced him down and deprived
him of his prize—probably to
restrain his penchant for dietetic
luxuries.”</p>

<h3>MENDICANCY LIMITED</h3>

<p>“Two constables dragged along a
shrieking girl, who every now and
then resisted progress by throwing
herself on the ground.... Of
what crime could a child of her age
possibly have been guilty? ... It
appeared that she had been begging
in support of an invalid mother, thus
tempting taxpaying citizens to an expenditure
of coin that should have been
reserved for other purposes....</p>

<p>“Begging, however, is not wholly
prohibited. Politicians often solicit
millions in behalf of candidates who
pledge themselves to protect the
associations of wealth and suppress
the holiday amusements of the poor.”</p>

<h3>WINGED REFUGEES</h3>

<p>“... saw nothing but a few
crows and two kingfishers, flitting up
and down the rocky banks of the
brook. Experience had made them
unapproachably shy, perhaps much to
the regret of the neighboring saints,
since they had probably been guilty
of fishing on Sunday.”</p>

<h3>A FASTING-CURE VICTORY</h3>

<p>“Some forty families had been
evicted to make room for a trainload
of meek immigrants, who agreed
to subsist on potatoes and the promise
of a better hereafter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[Pg 437]</span></p>

<h3>SKY LADDERS</h3>

<p>“Seclusion in the upper cavities of
these brick mountains must entail
incredible hardships, ... but the
landlords seem to hold that all these
discomforts are compensated by the
advantage of dwelling nearer heaven.”</p>

<h3>A CHEERING PROSPECT</h3>

<p>“In Oriental cities, with rare exceptions,
everything suggesting the
thought of death is hidden out of
view; no sculptor would venture to
exhibit an assortment of gravestones;
but people to whom life brings nothing
but a roundabout of toil and tedium
may find solace in contemplating mementoes
of the hour that will witness
the end of their doom.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The philanthropic traveler left his
native land with ideals presaging a
universal brotherhood of nations—perhaps
under the leadership of our
great Republic—but admits that, under
present circumstances, our popular
policy of expansion is, at best, only
an attempt to widen the ring-walls of
our slave-pen, before its gates are
closed by a syndicate of bloodsuckers
and boodle legislators.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The King’s Image</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY WALTER E. GROGAN<br />
<i>Author of “The Dregs of Wrath,” “The King’s Sceptre,” “The Curse of the
Fultons,” etc.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">I KNEW him at once. He was
grayer, he was grimmer, he was
more than ever like a man of
granite, hard and immobile, but I knew
him. The sight of him gravely unfolding
his table napkin and covering his
thin knees at luncheon in the little
hotel set my thoughts back over ten
years. I was then a lad of sixteen. I
had seen him constantly in the queer
medieval streets of Tsalburg, the little
capital of Ertaria in the Balkans.
Gray and grim, he was then the General
Commandant of the army, the
iron right hand of the Wolf King Peter
XII. He was grayer and grimmer
now, but undoubtedly the man. For
a while I racked my memory for his
name. It came suddenly. General
Hartzel! Undoubtedly the man.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> supplied me with many
conjectures. The senile old King was
dead; his heir, the Prince Paul, had
lived his own life in Europe incognito,
and the heir was not forthcoming.
Rumor said he was in Paris.</p>

<p>For three days I watched the General.
He knew no one at the hotel, he
spoke to no one, but I saw him more
than once in earnest conversation with
a young man about my own age, about
my own height, about my own color,
but—for the sake of my own vanity—alike
in no other particular. This was—the
information was easily come by—the
Comte de Troisétoilles, a young
Frenchman of position, now considerably
taken with the beautiful singer,
Mlle. Aimée Bergeaux. That was the
story noised about, and in proof thereof
her little steam yacht rode in the harbor,
he was constantly with her, and a
rumor was essential to the place. A
companion, large, fat, unmistakably
German and delightfully placid, cast
a broad, complacent smile of propriety
over the romance.</p>

<p>My General, I noted, snarled at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[Pg 438]</span>
soprano for whose smiles princes competed.
He was thorough, was my General,
dear man of stone. Venus herself
would have been baffled by him.
But he spoke earnestly and vehemently
to the Count, he who was so taciturn.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day I
met my General on the south cliff by the
absurd little fort. There was a streak
of smoke on the horizon. He was shaking
a fist at it, a violent, tempestuous
fist.</p>

<p>I have been a prey to sudden impulses
all my life. I had maintained
an Englishman’s reserve for three days.
I broke it suddenly on the cliff. I accosted
the General in Ertarian.</p>

<p>“You are disturbed, General Hartzel,”
I said.</p>

<p>He wheeled round surprisingly. His
astonishment grew when he saw me,
the silent companion of his luncheons.</p>

<p>“Monsieur speaks Ertarian,” he said.</p>

<p>“A little,” I answered modestly, yet
with inward elation. To surprise a
man of granite! Elation was surely
pardonable.</p>

<p>“As a native,” he continued. I
bowed. “It is wonderful! Are you
Ertarian?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied.</p>

<p>“No,” he echoed with regret. “You
are English. I saw you smoke a pipe.
But you know my real name? I am
Captain Schneidlitz here.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “Pardon me, General, I
have been amusing myself with your
surprise. My father was British Minister
at Tsalburg for many years. As a
boy I spent my holidays there. Hence
my accent.”</p>

<p>“Your name is—?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Havensea,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Then your father is ——?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I am now the head of
my family. It is a large family, General.
I have tens of aunts; my cousins
are limitless. I pass an uneasy life
trying to evade them and my unnecessary
title. It is difficult—please respect
my incognito as I respect yours,
Captain Schneidlitz.”</p>

<p>“You dislike your title?” he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“The coronet has given me a headache
of the soul. You don’t know how
terrible a British title is. It is a mere
lever for opening bazaars, a free ticket
to everybody’s dinners.”</p>

<p>“You object to yourself?” His
question, the question of the man of
granite, was tremulous with excitement.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” I answered; “not to
myself—but to the impossibility of
being myself. I am an English peer.
I have not even the picturesqueness
of poverty. You do not understand.
In Ertaria they do not hold flower
shows. I do not object to myself—I
object to Lord Havensea.”</p>

<p>The General looked round anxiously.
A wide-breeched soldier was walking
toward the fort; a white-stringed bonnet
was going home. Seaward the
streak of smoke blackened the eye of
the sun. The sight of that caused the
man of granite to swear solemnly in
Ertarian—a language admitting a wide
choice of expression to a man oppressed
with a sense of wrong.</p>

<p>“I will reply to your first question,”
he said. He spoke in a low voice. He
was under some strong emotion. “I
am disturbed. That little streak of
smoke dissolving out there represents
my hopes dissipated, evaporated. My
hopes are the hopes of Ertaria. We
are a small country, but we are proud.”</p>

<p>“A country’s pride invariably compensates
for lack of acres.”</p>

<p>“It is a jest to you,” he said sadly.
I had expected him to be angry at my
flippant remark. The sadness of his
voice slipped past my guard. Here at
last I had found a man who could feel.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, General,” I said
more soberly than I had previously
spoken. “The pride of Ertaria I know
rests upon an unstained national
honor.”</p>

<p>“If you believed that!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I do,” I answered stoutly. “Frankly,
you are all absurd, but it is a glorious
absurdity. Small, hemmed in by
enemies, you have kept an independence,
noble and untainted, for seven
hundred years.”</p>

<p>“You believe it! Why not?” he
cried excitedly. “Your father, the
dear Lord Havensea, loved us. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[Pg 439]</span>
was our friend. His representations
at St. James’s saved us once. You inherited
his love. We are in peril now.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said I, “the lost heir.”</p>

<p>“He is out there under that streak
of smoke.”</p>

<p>“He was the Comte de Troisétoilles?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The French singer is Russian.
You understand?”</p>

<p>“Kidnapped! Scratch a French soprano
and you will find a Russian.
My General!” I was indeed sorry for
him. He was honest, was this man of
granite. He loved his country. And
Prince Paul—“Royal robes should
cover men, not flattered fools.”</p>

<p>“You understand. The great game
is lost. I love Ertaria as I love nothing
else. I would pour out my blood
willingly for her. That would be
nothing. I have been the guardian of
her honor. That was everything.
And now the hand of the greedy Bear
is stretched out for it. And it is lost.
At least five minutes ago I said it was
lost. But now you—you can save it—the
great game, the honor of Ertaria,
the independence, the life-blood!”</p>

<p>“I! My dear General, I am a tired
English peer recovering from a surfeit
of municipal and parochial addresses.”</p>

<p>“You—only you. You are an Englishman,
you speak Ertarian, you resemble
the Prince Paul somewhat; he is
unknown in Ertaria. You are out of
love with your own identity; you long
for something else, for some other
life——”</p>

<p>“My dear General, speak out the
whole of your madness.”</p>

<p>“Come, Lord Havensea, and hold
the throne!”</p>

<p>I was staggered, astounded. For a
moment I watched the smoke becoming
thinner and thinner. Suddenly it
seemed to pop out. It was of course a
trick of the imagination.</p>

<p>“You are an Englishman—therefore
you have courage.”</p>

<p>It was transcendent flattery. A
throne!</p>

<p>“It is madness, my General,” I said.
His eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“It is the madness we love,” he said
softly. “And it is for the country, my
country. The poor fool will come
back. Don’t let it be too late. Keep
the throne for him—and for us, for the
Ertarian children unborn that they be
not born the slaves of the Muscovite.
You have read the history of Poland?”</p>

<p>“It is folly, but—” I commenced.</p>

<p>“The train starts tonight, my
Prince, at eleven. The West Station.
I will make all things ready.” The
General looked out at the winking sun.
The real Prince was kidnapped, but in
his dire need Fate had tossed him a
pseudo one.</p>

<p>It was the wildest of folly, of course,
but once seriously embarked upon, it
was remarkable how smoothly it ran.
I returned to the hotel, paid my bill,
sent my valet home to England, and
met the General at the station. I
entered the first-class compartment
a private English gentleman—even my
poor little title left in the custody of
my lawyers in Ely Place—and across
the Ertarian frontier I stepped out
Paul V.</p>

<p>We alighted at a small station.
There were three or four anxious-looking
men on its slender platform. They
were dressed in the frock coat of ceremony.
One man only was conspicuous
in a gorgeous uniform. It reminded
me of my own Havensea livery.
I was preparing to be royally
gracious to him when Hartzel whispered
he was the station-master. It
was a brilliant morning; the sun lay on
the white caps of the mountain pass
and glistened; big butterflies painted
the field; the air was clear, rarified. I
was in excellent spirits.</p>

<p>The General watched the absurd little
engine puff its way onward. Then
he turned to me, took off his hat, knelt
and kissed my hand. The spectacle
of my man of granite kneeling, his
honest, ugly face figured by emotion,
struck me strangely.</p>

<p>“To my God, my Country and my
King are my life and my honor dedicated,”
he said, the quaint old formula
of allegiance in Ertaria. The frock
coats went through the same performance.
It lacked the earnestness of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[Pg 440]</span>
General and had a note of anxiety.
They looked as though they were expecting
a troop of Cossacks over the
edge of the pass and were nervous.
But the ceremony marked a step in the
game. Until then I was in a transition
state. I was no longer Lord
Havensea, but I had not yet become
King until I had stepped out of my uncomfortable
compartment into a kingdom.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” I said in their own
picturesque tongue, “you are the first
of my subjects to welcome me. Not
as King will I speak to you now, but as
a fellow-worker, for my heart also is
dedicated to God and Ertaria.”</p>

<p>That struck some spark into their
dull faces.</p>

<p>“Seven centuries of liberty are in our
hands,” said I. “The dead fathers of
Ertaria have given us this heritage.
It is that which I come to preserve—in
peace if God wills, but if not, the
history of Ertaria tells us how to
act.”</p>

<p>Bombast if you will, but it brought
life, valor, strength into their faces.</p>

<p>As for the man of granite, his eyes
flashed. Ten minutes more and we
were galloping up the white ribbon of
a road toward Tsalburg, embarked
upon as mad a mission as was ever
enacted in this Balkan basin of mad
missions. Our frock-coated friends remained
behind. I kissed each on his
scrubby cheek, and told him to guard
our frontier. They swore to this with
tears in their eyes.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “we have played the
first act of the farce.”</p>

<p>“You have done well,” my mentor
replied. “But this is no farce. It is a
perilous game to play.”</p>

<p>“You did not tell me so before,
General. A spice of danger gives it a
zest.”</p>

<p>“You speak like a soldier.”</p>

<p>“I was a soldier—that was before I
became a peer and was a personage.
Shall I pass muster? Will they perceive
I am no King? Will the people
be with me?”</p>

<p>“Keep a brave heart and that will
carry you through. The Russian
Minister, of course, will know you are
an impostor.”</p>

<p>“The deuce he will!”</p>

<p>“You must bluff him.”</p>

<p>“And four weeks ago I received the
freedom of an English town from a
successful grocer! Hartzel, my blood
races! Here are romance, adventure!
I am your debtor for life!”</p>

<p>“That debt may be liquidated at
any moment,” he said grimly. For a
minute his old face softened, and then
it was as hard as ever. I knew that
some touch of remorse had stabbed him.
The game was nothing to me; he was
staking my life for a cause in which I
had no concern. Then came the
thought of his country. No life mattered
then.</p>

<p>That night we lay in a small town,
and I was shown secretly to a few of
the town’s chief men; and the next
night we slept in the General’s house at
Tsalburg. The rumor of my coming
circulated furiously. At eleven o’clock,
when I was preparing to rest, tired with
my long journey, a mob assembled in
the square outside and sang the national
anthem for an hour or so.
Hartzel harangued them from the balcony.
I was fatigued. I could not
be disturbed, but on the morrow their
King would meet them. That was the
purport of his speech. The national
anthem broke out again, and presently,
with the poetical inspiration of the
nation, they sang a legendary serenade.</p>

<p>Hartzel came to my room and sat
on the edge of my bed. I was nearly
dead with fatigue, but he was inexorable.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow will see the crucial test
of our scheme, so you must listen.
There are two factions in Ertaria. In
the late King’s reign I kept the Tertourgkis
in abeyance.”</p>

<p>“The Tertourgkis!” I cried, memory
stirring me. “They had some
feud with the reigning family and—and
there was a daughter.”</p>

<p>“You remember?” he said. “Prince
Tertourgki is an old man. His wealth
and his lands go to this daughter, his
only child. She is very beautiful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[Pg 441]</span></p>

<p>“She was a beautiful child, dark
and serene as night.”</p>

<p>“The Prince has claims to the throne.
He is the descendant of the Tertourgkis,
who reigned in the fifteenth century.
They were despots, and a revolution
set the Borros on the throne.
The Prince has never abrogated his
claim. There is a second cousin——”</p>

<p>“My General, the rest is easy to decipher.
The second cousin has aspirations
for the hand of the Princess
Marie; he is the puppet of the Russians;
the Tertourgkis’ influence is great; we
fear the loyalty of the army; we must
deal quickly with the second cousin.”</p>

<p>“You are quick at guessing,” the
General answered slowly. “You
know——”</p>

<p>“On my word, nothing—nothing but
the name of the Princess Marie. When
the world was younger, General, there
was a large garden and a young schoolboy—he
thought himself a man—and
a little child and flowers. Together
they made a happy time. The sun
was always shining. The little child
worshiped the big schoolboy—and he
graciously permitted it.”</p>

<p>“Your father’s house! Ah, well, you
know something, but not all. As the
King lay dying I—I arranged a marriage
between the Princess Marie and
the absent Paul.”</p>

<p>I sat up in bed.</p>

<p>“The Prince Paul!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“The Prince Paul,” he assented
stolidly. “He consented. The Prince
looked kindly upon it; the Princess
would not give a definite answer.
When the Prince arrived, she said,
she would give him her answer personally.”</p>

<p>“This is your arrangement?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“It was a diplomatic stroke,” he
said.</p>

<p>“You took an unwarrantable liberty,”
I cried warmly. “Why was I
not told of this before?”</p>

<p>“Because you would not have
come.”</p>

<p>“And now?”</p>

<p>“Now it is different. You are
caught in the toils.”</p>

<p>“It is an unwarrantable liberty!
You have engaged me matrimonially
without any reference to my feelings.”</p>

<p>“I have engaged Prince Paul.”</p>

<p>“Who am I?”</p>

<p>“Who you are for the present. My
dear Havensea, you do not consider
my position.”</p>

<p>“You have had precious little consideration
for mine!”</p>

<p>“It is not yours. You are an actor
playing a role. In a short while you
will make a graceful bow and exit.”</p>

<p>“I am not at all sure that it will be
graceful.”</p>

<p>“As you will. That does not matter
at all. You play a part for a little
while. They will not dare to keep the
real Prince a prisoner for long.”</p>

<p>“I am to cheat this girl?”</p>

<p>“What does it matter? It is a
royal alliance—there are no considerations
but that of policy. I do not
propose to marry you to her.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. That is considerate.”</p>

<p>“My dear Havensea, you are perturbed.
The Princess is to marry the
Crown. She is piqued at the long delay
of the Prince. There is no question
of sentiment.”</p>

<p>“Suppose there were?”</p>

<p>He looked at me curiously for a
moment.</p>

<p>“That is a proposition I will not entertain,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“I will not do it!” I cried angrily.</p>

<p>“You will,” he replied quietly.
“You have already impersonated the
King. Have you considered the consequences?
I say nothing about you.
You are a brave man. But you have
already compromised many honest
men—and one dishonest old man. We
are only half civilized. That is part of
our charm—at least to you. The
people would be very angry. You
would be killed!”</p>

<p>“By Jove, you are a pleasant philosopher!”</p>

<p>“To a brave man that may mean
little—life is a mere stake. But the
honest men and the dishonest old man
would die also. You could not have
my death upon your conscience!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[Pg 442]</span></p>

<p>“You deserve it, my General; you
deserve it, on my honor!”</p>

<p>“Possibly.” He waved it aside
resolutely as a matter of small consequence.
“There is also Ertaria. Shall
we grant that the Princess may not be
happy? Then there is one woman unhappy
and a nation free. Havensea,
you do not understand the stake for
which we play. It is not a crown, nor
a woman’s heart, but a nation’s freedom.
The heel of Russia bruises the
very souls of men. Russia knouts a
man’s soul. Where is Poland today?
It is a great game to save a nation from
that curse.”</p>

<p>The man of granite spoke soberly.
There was no impassioned appeal. He
spoke of facts. As a boy I knew something
of this terror of Russia. This
rugged, hard man was a hero. He
played his life not for advancement,
but for the good of his country. My
heart warmed to him. And, as he said,
there was also Ertaria.</p>

<p>“I shall go through with it, General,”
I said at length. Our hands closed
on that; in the winking light of a
candle I saw his eyes glitter. He did
not speak for a full minute. Then he
muttered in a low voice, “If you were
only a Borro!”</p>

<p>“It would have been fatiguing,” I
said. “I should have quarreled with
you. There is not room on the throne
for two men.”</p>

<p>He laughed abruptly at that.</p>

<p>The next morning General Hartzel
aroused me at an unearthly hour. He
made me dress in a steel-corseleted
uniform. It was exceedingly gorgeous
and stiff with gold lace.</p>

<p>“It is the uniform of the Colonel of
the Royal Guards,” he told me.</p>

<p>“Promotion is rapid in Ertaria,” I
said. “I was an unconsidered subaltern
in our Blues.”</p>

<p>“The army is reviewed today on
the Plain of Liberty,” he said, “by
Prince Tertourgki. He is regent during
your absence.”</p>

<p>“And the second cousin?”</p>

<p>“Is his aide-de-camp—Prince Otho.
The Russian Minister will be there.”</p>

<p>“And his august name?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“Baron Ivaniski.”</p>

<p>“My dear General!” I cried. “There
is a saying, ‘The luck of the Havenseas.’
The luck holds good. The Russian
Bear shall dance, I promise you!”</p>

<p>“What does Your Majesty mean?”</p>

<p>“His Majesty knows a story, General,
a pretty, ornate and most scandalous
story. Ivaniski was an attaché at
Berlin when my uncle was Ambassador.
It will be the only good turn Uncle
John has ever done me.”</p>

<p>For two mortal hours after a particularly
disappointing breakfast—the
General betrayed but an indifferent regard
to cuisine—I was gracious to the
peculiarly uninteresting big men of
Tsalburg. I signed innumerable papers,
and at a hint from the General kissed
those worthy of the honor. It afforded
them far more satisfaction than it did
me.</p>

<p>At noon I mounted a black charger,
and, accompanied only by the General,
set out for the Plain of Liberty.
Hartzel had misled—to use a euphemism—the
populace as to my movements,
so that it was merely at odd
whiles that I was called upon to acknowledge
shouts of greeting.</p>

<p>The Plain of Liberty is a tableland
upon the hill that rises above the town.
From it Tsalburg can be seen spread
out in picturesque confusion. It is a
big plain, and its name is derived from
the presence in its centre of a huge
column surmounted by a figure of Liberty.
On the base of this column are
inscribed the names of the more or less
traditional heroes who are popularly
supposed to have engineered the independence
of the country. This column
has become a subject of sentimental
worship with the nation.</p>

<p>On this plain were assembled the
populace of Tsalburg to witness the
review of the major part of the troops
of the country, some fifteen thousand.
Prince Tertourgki had selected a place
near the column as a saluting base, and
the troops, when we arrived, were
drawn up in review order. The column
stood, as it were, a huge, gray sentinel
between the Prince and the troops.</p>

<p>“Some of the officers I could trust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[Pg 443]</span>
expect you!” the General cried. “Spur
on to the troops. Now is our crisis.
The Baron has tampered with some of
the regiments, but to what extent I
cannot say. If the troops receive you
Ertaria is saved.”</p>

<p>“Your true gambler risks all on a
single throw!” I shouted, clapping
spurs into my charger. It was a glorious
gallop. My blood raced in my
veins. My horse was maddened by the
touch of the spur. I thundered on
down the level turf. I saw the stir
of surprise in the populace. I caught
a waver of ranks as the troops craned
forward to see me come. Then a
flash of inspiration came to me. As
I raced by the column I suddenly drew
rein, flinging my horse back on his
haunches. For a moment he lay
crouched backward, and in that moment
I had raised my sword in salute
of the column. Then the charger leaped
forward, and I rode to the front of the
troops.</p>

<p>Such a shout greeted me as I have
never heard before. It roared about
my ears like thunder. “Long live the
King!” they cried, and the populace
took up the words, “Long live the
King!”</p>

<p>I raised my hand and there was silence.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” I shouted, “we all alike
serve under Liberty. The statue of
our dead heroes watches over King and
people.” Again the air was rent.</p>

<p>I turned. General Hartzel, following
me, had just cantered up. On his
grim, granite face was a smile like
wintry sunshine.</p>

<p>“General Hartzel,” I cried, “you
will march the troops past in review
order!” Then I cantered over to the
saluting base. I was King!</p>

<p>An old man in uniform was fidgeting
about on a gray horse. At his side was
a young officer, dark, almost swarthy,
whispering eagerly. In a landau at the
back sat a frock-coated gentleman with
an order in his buttonhole. He had
the broadness between the eyes of the
Tartar. With him was the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen. Out of
her big black eyes shone the light of
admiration. In a mist I saw again the
small child in the garden, her wondering
worship and the big English schoolboy.</p>

<p>“Prince,” I cried, “will you do me
the honor of taking the salute?” I
spoke to him so as to force an answer.
The unexpected compliment flustered
him.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” he faltered, “my
usefulness is over.”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, engineering my restive
charger to the discomfiture of the
second cousin, “we will work together
for Ertaria, Prince.” I held out my
hand, and in a moment the white-haired
old fellow was off his horse and
kneeling, kissing my hand. How the
populace roared aloud their pleasure!
The bands crashed out the national
anthem, ladies fluttered their scarfs, a
whole forest of hats waved in the air.
I was King, and apparently popular.
It was an exhilarating feeling. I
thought of the real Paul shut up in a
satinwood cabin on board a kicking
little steam yacht, and smiled.</p>

<p>The Prince and I took the salute; he
reined in to a respectful distance. Afterward
I was conducted to the landau.
The Prince stayed a moment to speak
to the second cousin. I rode up alone
and dismounted.</p>

<p>“Have you no welcome for the King,
Princess Marie?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You know me? My father told
you?” Her voice was serene, low, like
silver bells on a summer evening.</p>

<p>“No. The Prince has said nothing.
But I knew that the Princess Marie was
the most beautiful woman in Ertaria.”
She smiled at me. I met her smiling
eyes. It was then I regretted that I
was merely playing a part. The small
child had grown into a wondrously
beautiful woman. I know that from
the moment my eyes met hers in that
long look I loved her. Hers were eloquent
also, so eloquent that she veiled
them quickly with long, thick, black,
curling lashes, and the rich color
mounted to her cheek.</p>

<p>“But Your Majesty,” the Russian’s
lips curled in a sneer, “has seen the
Princess’s photograph.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[Pg 444]</span></p>

<p>“One has no conception of sunlight
from observation of the moon, Baron,”
I answered.</p>

<p>“And you are really the King, Paul
V.” His voice was challenging, his
eyes were gleaming with anger. The
elaborate and desperate project of kidnapping
the Prince had failed at the
very moment of its success. In his
pocket, I thought, were the particulars
of Paul’s involuntary voyage, and yet
here was a king to thwart all his plans.</p>

<p>“And you are really the Baron
Ivaniski—of Berlin?” He grew white
to the lips at the concealed threat in
my voice.</p>

<p>“Of Berlin?” he faltered. “I have
no connection with Berlin.”</p>

<p>“Your memory is short, Baron. In
November of ’84 you were surely in
Berlin. I believe, if I tried, I could
persuade you of that. Lord Derwenthurst
was a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I had forgotten,” he muttered.
I could have laughed at him,
he had become so craven and so
cringing. Uncle John had told me of
the Baron and his gambling debts,
and his attempt to sell a Russian secret
to us. Uncle John was too honest
for a diplomat. He refused, and extracted
from the young attaché a
signed declaration of his treason.
The alternative was that of forwarding
the proposal to the Russian Ambassador.</p>

<p>Riding to the palace with my
granite General, he expressed approval
of my day’s work.</p>

<p>“Ah, General,” said I, “the public
enthusiasm is stimulating. Not all
the school children of my native town,
bribed by oranges and buns, can shout
like your honest people.”</p>

<p>“And the Princess?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“And the Princess is divine.”</p>

<p>A week passed in a whirl of popular
excitement. No one guessed; the Russian
dared not speak openly. In any
case I hardly think Russia would have
avowed her kidnapping of the Prince.
As it was, the Baron had too great a
fear of the document he believed I
held. On the second day the Princess
gave me her answer. We were betrothed.
Public joy expressed itself
in gala nights at the Opera, in fireworks,
in torchlight processions. And
for me all the zest of the game I was
playing departed. As I listened to
Marie, as I learned from her own lips
that she loved me, I realized bitterly
the part I was playing. Not all the
General’s sophistries could disguise it
from me. I was cheating her. And
her trust was perfect. I writhed under
her praise, I was tortured by the possession
of her love, a possession which,
come by honestly, I would have treasured
beyond all else.</p>

<p>On the eighth day, the evening of
the gala ball, my granite General came
to my private chamber.</p>

<p>“The <i>Coquette</i> entered Trieste last
night,” he said harshly. I started.
<i>Coquette</i> was the name of the soprano’s
yacht.</p>

<p>“Well?” I replied. We stared at
each other. General Hartzel had been
growing brusk and ill-humored with
me. I think he guessed at the
romance.</p>

<p>“The King will be here tomorrow
night.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I answer that by saying
the King is here?”</p>

<p>“You will not do that. Your honor
is engaged.”</p>

<p>“You have been teaching me to do
without honor.”</p>

<p>“I must tell her tonight.”</p>

<p>I rose. “You will not. I will tell
her.”</p>

<p>“You will seek to dissuade her!”</p>

<p>“I will tell her. It is my right,
Hartzel.”</p>

<p>“You promise——?”</p>

<p>“I promise nothing. Man, do you
think I will slink out of this like a
whipped cur? I have cheated. I will
confess.”</p>

<p>After the first ceremonial reception
I slipped into the dark garden. My
brain was hot. I wanted to feel the
soft coolness of the night. In an
avenue I stumbled upon the Prince
Otho and the Russian Baron. They
barred my way.</p>

<p>“Impostor!” cried the Prince. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[Pg 445]</span>
news had leaked out. The Russian
knew and had told his friend.</p>

<p>I took off my glove and struck him
in the face.</p>

<p>“After the fourth waltz,” I said.
“There is a moon. In the walled garden.
And, gentlemen, whatever you
may know, keep silence. Berlin will
speak if you do.”</p>

<p>I sought Hartzel. He was not
difficult to find. He was dogging my
steps like a spy. I told him of my
meeting in the garden, and asked him
to be my second.</p>

<p>“He is a good swordsman,” he said.
I think he was sorry.</p>

<p>“Then I sincerely hope the real Paul
won’t miss his train. To have the
throne vacant again would be annoying.”</p>

<p>“And you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My dear General,” I said, with a
smile, “when a man is giving up a
pearl of infinite value he does not care
much for the tarnished gold of his own
life.”</p>

<p>The fourth waltz I danced with the
Princess Marie.</p>

<p>“I wish to speak to you soberly,
seriously, sedately, Marie. May I?
Come to the little conservatory and sit
out the thirteenth.”</p>

<p>“It is an unlucky number.”</p>

<p>“No number is unlucky that gives
me your presence,” I said lightly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the moonlight we stripped to our
shirts. It was nearly as light as day.</p>

<p>“This is a mistake,” my granite
General said. He was thinking of the
risk to his scheme and the ease with
which both men could have been
arrested.</p>

<p>“No, General. This may be reparation,”
I answered.</p>

<p>Prince Otho was an excellent swordsman.
That I knew at once. His
wrist was supple and strong as steel.
We engaged and fought slowly, cautiously.
He had a dangerous, wicked
riposte which I guarded twice, more
by luck than by skill. Undoubtedly
he was my master. I smiled grimly
at this. I was sorry, because I wished
to speak to Marie. And yet, perhaps,
this was a better way. Ah, a scratch!
I had turned too late, and the sting
in my shoulder told me I was hit.</p>

<p>“He is hit! It is enough!” cried
General Hartzel.</p>

<p>“A mere scratch!” I answered hotly,
and we engaged again. It was evident
the Prince was waiting for an
opening to kill. Two opportunities
for serious wounds he passed. Then
suddenly he made a quick lunge over
my guard. I stepped back quickly;
he could not recover his guard; he fell
back. Hartzel leaned over him.</p>

<p>“That ends it,” he said complacently.
“Four weeks, at least, in bed.
This is an accident, Baron.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The thirteenth dance. The lights
were very low. There was the heavy,
thick scent of gardenias. The Chinese
lanterns swayed curiously. When I
pulled myself together they were still.
The wound pricked unpleasantly.</p>

<p>Marie came.</p>

<p>“This is most unorthodox, Your
Majesty,” she said mockingly. “Everyone
is asking for you.”</p>

<p>“Will you sit down, dear?” I spoke
very slowly. In truth the pain in my
arm was like a red-hot steel needle.
She sobered quickly. I could not see
very well. I think she went white.
She sat down meekly. I could see her
big eyes, only her eyes.</p>

<p>“Paul!” she breathed.</p>

<p>“I am not Paul,” I said. “I am not
King. I am only the King’s image, a
poor counterfeit.”</p>

<p>“Paul!” she said again. Then she
checked herself.</p>

<p>“He will be here tomorrow. My
period of usefulness will be over. He—he
was kidnapped. I came—because
I was bored, because there was
some chance of adventure, because an
old man pleaded for his country. Now
it is all over—the King comes, the
King’s image is wanted no longer.”</p>

<p>“Paul, I want you,” she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“I am not Paul. And—and, Marie,
there is duty! A nation may groan
under the tyranny of Russia unless—You
understand, Marie. Our lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[Pg 446]</span>
cannot always be ministers to our desires.
We—we are caught in the toils;
we can only obey, we can only do our
duty, trusting that somehow it will be
found good.”</p>

<p>“For us?” she asked.</p>

<p>“For your people.”</p>

<p>“You say that that is my duty,
Paul?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you love me?”</p>

<p>“And I love you,” I answered. The
lanterns were swinging madly now.
Over their light was a new mist growing,
growing. I bit my lip—but the
throb of the wound was agony.</p>

<p>“I believe you, dear,” she said simply.
“It—it seems hard that—that
so much should rest upon one poor
girl. I think I know what—you mean.
The people shall be happy though the
Queen’s heart break.” She rose and
came toward me. She caught me by
my wounded shoulder and kissed me.
And with all the agony of it that kiss
I hold in my heart always as a dear
memory.</p>

<p>When she went the lanterns whirled,
the mist shut down on my eyes, and I
fell. General Hartzel found me.</p>

<p>The next morning early, recovered
of my swoon, I rode out of Tsalburg.
General Hartzel rode with me a little
way.</p>

<p>“If you had only been the real King,”
he said, with more feeling than I
thought possible, “and not——”</p>

<p>“And not the King’s image,” I
filled in. “It is a pity when the clay
image has a living heart.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Story of a Suppressed Populist
Newspaper</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY THOMAS H. TIBBLES<br />
<i>People’s Party Candidate for Vice-President</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT one time there were fifteen hundred
weekly papers advocating
the principles of the Omaha
platform. Some of them had large
plants, some only a few cases of type
and a Washington press, but all were
actuated by one purpose—to make
conditions easier for those who toiled
on farms, in shops, factories, mines
and mills. Among those still fighting
up to the first of April of this
year was the <i>Nebraska Independent</i>.
Many such papers were crushed by
various devices, chief among which
was that the great advertisers of
the land, all being allied with Wall
Street, refused to give them any business.
Numerous instances could be
cited where Populist papers were refused
advertisements given to plutocratic
papers not having one-tenth the
circulation, and paid for at a higher
rate than the proprietors of the Populist
papers would have taken. In the
files of the <i>Nebraska Independent</i> may
be found scores of letters from advertising
agents, who had been solicited
for business, saying: “If you will make
your paper an exclusively agricultural
journal we will be glad to give you a
good line of business, but we cannot
patronize it as long as it advocates
Populism.” Every reform editor has
had the same experience.</p>

<p>Thirteen years ago the agricultural
papers everywhere were publishing
articles defending Populist principles.
Then all at once such articles were seen
in their pages no more, and immediately
the papers were flooded with high-priced
advertising. The religious press
was caught in the same trap. It is
strange that the devout readers of
those papers never once had their suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[Pg 447]</span>
aroused when they saw so many
display advertisements of trusts, banks
and promotion schemes in their modest
little religious journals. Notwithstanding
all such schemes, the <i>Nebraska
Independent</i> lived and its circulation
gradually extended into every
state and territory. It became evident
that to get rid of it other tactics
would have to be employed. To destroy
the paper was not the objective.
It was to destroy the People’s Party.
With the <i>Independent</i> in hostile hands
the political fortifications built up by
it in Nebraska and other states would
be deserted and the Bryan, Belmont,
Sheehan and Tom Taggart Democratic
Party could walk in and take
possession.</p>

<p>The main battle was fought in the
Populist state convention August 10,
1904. The proposition to force a
fusion with the Democrats under the
lead of the most disreputable end of
Wall Street, fresh from its victory in
St. Louis, on the face of it was most
absurd. But the doing of absurd
things never ruffles the placid countenance
of Mr. Bryan. The idea that
there could be any real opposition to
his imperial will in Nebraska, aside
from the Republican Party, never
seemed to enter his mind. Heretofore
when Mr. Bryan entered a Democratic
or Populist convention, the
Fusion Populists and Democrats immediately
bowed and worshiped. The
only thing that convention had to do
was to find out what Mr. Bryan wished
and then proceed to do it with all possible
haste. It became evident that
this convention would have to be
handled differently. Mr. Bryan all
the winter, spring and summer had
been denouncing Judge Parker as a
“dishonest candidate, running on a
dishonest platform,” and then he had
come home from St. Louis, sat down
at his desk and the first words that he
wrote were: “I shall vote for Parker
and Davis.” The Populists remembered
how for eight years he had been
coming to their conventions, and in
his sweet and winning way telling them
how noble they were to put principle
above party and vote for men of another
party if they thought they could
advance reform by so doing. Many
of them, who had always supported
Mr. Bryan since he first appeared on
the battlefields of politics, thought that
the time had come when he should
practice what he preached. Mr. Bryan
realized that there was trouble ahead,
but it was thought if the <i>Nebraska
Independent</i> would support the Bryan
plan that a fusion legislature could be
elected that would send Mr. Bryan to
the United States Senate.</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Independent</i> was
obstreperous. He had had enough of
fusion with a party half of which was
more disreputably plutocratic than
the Republican Party, and whose
“irrevocable” rules were so rigid that
they required a man, upon a vote of a
convention, to come out boldly before
the people and advocate a policy
he had denounced by pen and voice
for eight years. All sorts of schemes
were devised to bring this obstreperous
editor into subjection to the imperial
will of Mr. Bryan. The first was to
send all the leading men of the state,
from the Chief Justice down, to use
persuasion. That failed. Then Mr.
Bryan’s personal daily organ in the
state tried a new deal. It poured out
on Mr. Tibbles the most fulsome flattery
day after day. It said if he would
only say “fusion” every Populist in
the state would obey his command.
When all that failed Mr. Bryan came
himself. The proposition that he made
was that a fusion electoral ticket be
put in the field composed of four Populists
and four Democrats, Mr. Bryan
saying that, “in the event of their
election, each party could count the
full vote as its own.” The proposition
was instantly rejected. Others followed.
Mr. Bryan came to the <i>Independent</i>
editorial-room four different
times, using all his eloquence and persuasive
powers to get the editor to consent
to and advocate a fusion with a
party that had nominated Parker, and
whose campaign was put into the hands
of the most disreputable gang that ever
sought Wall Street favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[Pg 448]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bryan gave orders that everything
visible, clear to the political
horizon, and other things invisible
lying behind the floating clouds,
should be offered to the Populist
convention providing that the
Populists would fuse. The battle was
fought out on the convention floor.
Many Democrats had secured seats as
delegates. One Democrat came over
from his own convention and answered
to the call of Thurston County
in the Populist convention which had
no delegates present, and voted the
fifteen votes that county was entitled to
every time for fusion. Out of the hell-broth
brewed in that all-night session
there floated upon the fusion scum
Bryan, Belmont, Sheehan, Tom Taggart
and, remember this last name,
George W. Berge.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole state ticket was
given to the Populists—only three unimportant
offices being conceded to
the Democrats, and Berge—George
Washington Berge—captured the
prize infamy, the fusion nomination
for Governor. Bryan would allow no
other name to be mentioned in the
Democratic convention, although there
were two or three Democrats there
who had spent time and much money
during the previous eight years fighting
Bryan’s battles for him, and who had
expressed a desire to receive a complimentary
vote for that office. When
Bryan speaks the <i>Nebraska Democrat</i>
turns pale.</p>

<p>The <i>Independent</i> was still a thorn in
the side of these fusionists. The
editor openly declared that he never
would vote for or support a Belmont-Bryan-Parker
Democrat. Then it was
that fusion itch for office and Bryan diplomacy
joined forces to destroy the <i>Independent</i>.
The plutocratic Republican
attacks upon it had been of no avail,
and week after week it had proclaimed
the doctrines of the People’s Party for
ten years. In an open fight against
awful odds it had fought battle after
battle, sometimes victorious and sometimes
defeated, but it fought on. It
took fusion treason, it took the work
of men who constantly proclaimed
themselves Populists, who insisted
upon attending Populist conventions
while their sole aim was to destroy
the People’s Party, to do what all
the hosts of plutocracy had failed to
do.</p>

<p>As soon as the vote for fusion had
been announced in the convention as
prevailing, more than half the delegates
present—whole counties had been
voted for fusion when only one or two
delegates were in the city—rose and
left. The next morning they hired a
hall and discussed the proposition of
putting a straight Populist ticket in
the field, but when it was remembered
that the fusionists had the legal organization
and the ticket would have to go
on the ballot under some other name
than People’s Party the project was
abandoned. The result was that
20,000 Populists voted the Republican
ticket, 30,000 stayed at home and refused
to vote, and a little over 20,000
voted the Populist national ticket.
The Senate of the Nebraska Legislature
was solidly Republican; the House had
only nine fusionists in it. Mr. Bryan
saw to it that they all cast their votes
for a straight Democrat for United
States Senator. All that was necessary
to get the fusionists to do that, both
those who called themselves Democrats
and those who called themselves
Populists, was for them to imagine
that they heard a far-off rumble that
sounded like the voice of Bryan saying:
“Vote for a Democrat.”</p>

<p>When the conventions were over
and the campaign committees appointed,
the fusionists found that it
was a difficult thing to make a campaign
in Nebraska. Something must
be done to get the <i>Independent</i> to fight
the battle for them, but the <i>Independent</i>
still declared that it would not
support a Parker Democrat. Then,
sad to relate, the editor of the <i>Independent</i>
got taken in himself.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Democratic
State Committee, a brother-in-law to
Bryan, came to Mr. Tibbles declaring
that he represented Mr. Bryan and was
speaking in Bryan’s name, and made
the following proposition:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[Pg 449]</span></p>

<p>If Mr. Tibbles would spend most of
his time out of the state during the
campaign, and let the <i>Independent</i>
support the fusion ticket, all of whose
nominees except three were Populists,
Mr. Bryan on his part would agree to
go to Arizona or Colorado and get sick.
He would continue to keep sick until
the close of the campaign, so sick that
he would not be able to make any
political speeches at all. An exception
was made in regard to Indiana.
It was said that Mr. Bryan had
promised to make three speeches in
Indiana in support of his old personal
friend who was running for Governor
in that state, but it was further
stipulated that these three speeches
should not be political speeches, but
repetitions of Mr. Bryan’s lecture on
“Ideals.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bryan went to Arizona and sent
home a letter saying that he was worse
and would not be able to deliver any
political speeches during the campaign.
That letter was printed in the
Lincoln daily papers and was shown
to Mr. Tibbles as proof that Mr.
Bryan was keeping his contract.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Democratic
State Committee went to New York,
saw Parker, Sheehan, Belmont, Tom
Taggart and the rest of the band of
financial and political pirates. He
came home with money for campaign
expenses. Then Mr. Bryan hired a
special train and started out speech-making
in Nebraska and in other
states. The surprising rapidity with
which his lung healed has never been
equaled in all the history of medicine.
But when the votes were counted it
was learned that wherever Mr. Bryan
spoke, whether from the rear end of
his car, on a platform by the railway
side, or in theatre or hall, a tidal wave
of Republican votes followed him,
although he pleaded with his Democratic
hearers to be “regular.” Hundreds
of thousands of Democrats
listened to this man, who for eight
years had been denouncing Wall Street
and all its ways, and was now consorting
with the most disreputable part of
Wall Street, urging them to vote to
keep it in power. Humiliated, sad at
heart, their idol carrying the banner
of the enemy, in the enemy’s ranks,
they turned their backs in scorn upon
Mr. Bryan, went to the polls and
voted the Republican ticket. If they
were to have Wall Street and plutocracy,
they wanted the old, genuine
article, not “something just as good.”
The fusionists declared that wherever
Watson or Tibbles spoke they made
votes for Roosevelt. They did not
make one Roosevelt vote where Bryan
made a thousand.</p>

<p>Mr. Berge—George Washington
Berge—received a large vote for Governor.
That was because Mickey, the
Republican, who was running for re-election,
was cordially hated by the
whole Republican Party. Thirty
thousand Republicans voted for
Berge, and then he was defeated.
But Berge is a fusionist. He wants
office, and especially the office of
Governor of Nebraska.</p>

<p>It seemed necessary, if Mr. Bryan
was to prove his undying love for the
Democratic Party, to convince all
Eastern Democrats that he would forever
prove “regular” no matter who
was nominated or what the platform
was, and it seemed to the fusionists, if
they were to have any of the spoils of
victory when the national Government
was captured, that the People’s Party
must be destroyed. It must never
hold another state or national convention.
They all agreed that the
party had done a wonderful work for
the nation, that its principles were
being everywhere adopted, but it
must be crucified, officially pronounced
dead and buried, and the
first step toward that object was the
destruction of the <i>Nebraska Independent</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Berge is a lawyer. He never
has had a day’s experience in a newspaper
office. He announced that he
would start a paper in Lincoln in opposition
to the <i>Independent</i>. Then a
proposition was made to the proprietor
of the <i>Independent</i> to sell out. A very
large price was offered. When the
proprietor faced these facts he began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[Pg 450]</span>
to get discouraged. He had grown up
in Lincoln. He had associated with
these fusionists for years. The fight
which he saw in the near future with
these men was an unpleasant thing to
contemplate. The cost of running a
great newspaper plant is large. When
it was known that the home advertising
would in part be lost, and also a
large share of the job work, the moment
the editor defied Bryan and the
fusionists, the outlook was gloomy.
To those whom the <i>Independent</i> had
always fought in the city and state
were to be added hundreds of others
who had passed as friends. And the
proprietor became discouraged.</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> somewhat discouraging to go
to a convention ostensibly composed
of men of your own party and see
the most active members of it engaged
in a scheme to destroy your party.
These have been the conditions in
every Populist convention in the state
of Nebraska since 1890. The only
thing that prevented the party from
being destroyed sooner was the <i>Nebraska
Independent</i>. The fusionists became
more and more convinced of that
fact, and the scheme was invented to
publish a paper in opposition in the
same city, which, while claiming to be
Populistic, would work for the destruction
of the party. Credit for the
invention belongs to George Washington
Berge. The hope was entertained
that when the People’s Party
was destroyed all the Populists would
go into the Democratic Party, and
George Washington Berge would be
Governor and W. J. Bryan United
States Senator.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the <i>Independent</i>
was bound in the contract transferring
to George Washington Berge the title
to the paper, not to engage in the
business of publishing a reform paper
for five years, but the fusionists found
that it would be impossible to put any
shackles on the editor. He intends to
fight on. Just as all the world is beginning
to accept Populist principles
he does not propose to sheathe his
sword and stand by, a passive spectator.
The greatest battle of the age is to
be fought. He “is going up against”
that crowd again.</p>

<p>The columns of the <i>Independent</i>
have been an open forum for any man
who thought he had something that
would benefit humanity. In the columns
of the paper he could always
voice his sentiments. Besides that,
it has been a journal of economics,
sociology, philosophy, ethics, finance,
single tax, land, Government and all
the decent news. Now it has gone
into the hands of an ordinary Western
lawyer who never read a standard
work of authority on any one of these
subjects. It is to be a personal organ
after the fashion of the one that
W. J. Bryan publishes in the same
town. W. J. Bryan is the most accomplished
orator of the day. He
has personal acquaintances in every
state and territory. Millions have
met and shaken hands with him.
George W. Berge has some acquaintances
outside of Lancaster County,
Nebraska, and besides that, Berge is a
Populist engaged in destroying the
Populist Party. These are his elements
of success.</p>

<p>The Populists of the different states
and territories who have been readers
of the <i>Independent</i> will in the near
future have a place to express their
views and read discussions of the great
problems that are pressing for solution.
We will be heard. For years not a
great daily would print a line in defense
of the fundamental principles of
Populism. Now magazines are making
fortunes for their proprietors who
have admitted some of these principles
to their pages. Some of these magazines
have a greater circulation than
was ever known before anywhere in
the world for monthly periodical literature.
The People’s Party is not
dead. The <i>Nebraska Independent</i> will
rise from its ashes stronger and better
than ever before. The vilest, rottenest,
worst smelling spot in all the
preserves of plutocracy is that place
where the fusionist roams, seeking to
destroy the organization that gave
him the only opportunities of his
life.</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below2">In a small Georgia town a friendship has grown up
between Pole Baker, reformed moonshiner and an unusual
and likable character, and young Nelson Floyd,
who was left as a baby in a mountain cabin by an unknown
woman just before her death. Floyd, in the
face of many trials and temptations, has worked his
way up in the world and made a man of himself. Jeff
Wade appears at the store, in which Floyd has become
a partner, to avenge on him a rumored injustice to
Wade’s sister. Pole Baker’s tact prevents a duel by
making Floyd see that the unselfish course is for him
to avoid a meeting. Cynthia Porter comes to the
store, alarmed for Floyd’s safety. On his way home
to his family Pole falls a victim to his besetting sin of
drink. Cynthia rejects the suit of the Rev. Jason
Hillhouse and refuses to act on his warnings against
Floyd’s attentions. At a corn-shucking given by
Pole, Floyd wins the right to kiss Cynthia, and on
their way home claims his privilege without actually
asking to marry her and proposes in vain that, since
her mother dislikes him, she meet him at times on
signal in the grape-arbor. That night, while Cynthia
is regretting even her slight weakness, her suspicious
and tactless mother half accuses her and hints that
the worry over Cynthia and Floyd has caused her to
fear an attack of insanity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the following Saturday morning
there was a considerable
gathering of farmers at Springtown.
A heavy fall of rain during the
night had rendered the soil unfit for
plowing, and it was a sort of enforced
holiday. Many of them stood around
Mayhew &amp; Floyd’s store. Several
women and children were seated between
the two long counters, on boxes
and the few available chairs. Nelson
Floyd was at the high desk in the rear,
occupied with business letters, when
Pole Baker came in at the back door
and stood near him, closely scanning
the long room.</p>

<p>“Where’s the old man?” he asked
when Floyd looked up and saw him.</p>

<p>“Not down yet; dry up, Pole! I
was making a calculation and you
knocked it hell-west and crooked.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon that kin wait. I’ve
got a note fer you.” Pole was taking
it from his coat pocket.</p>

<p>“Miss Cynthia?” Floyd asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot,” said Pole.
“I reckon maybe you’ll wish it was.”
He threw the missive on the desk and
went on in quite a portentous tone:
“I come by Jeff Wade’s house, Nelson,
on my way back from the mill. He
was inside with his wife and childern,
an’ as I was passin’ one of the little
boys run out to the fence and called
me in to whar he was. He’s a queer
fellow! I saw he was tryin’ to keep his
wife in the dark, fer what you reckon
he said?”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” The young
merchant, with a serious expression of
face, had torn open the envelope but
not yet unfolded the sheet of cheap,
blue-lined writing paper.</p>

<p>“Why, he jest set thar in his chair
before the fire, an’ as he handed it up
to me he sorter looked knowin’ an’
said, said he: ‘Pole, I’m owin’ Mayhew
&amp; Floyd a little balance on my account,
an’ they seem uneasy. I wish
you’d take this here note to young
Floyd. He’s always stood to me sorter,
an’ I believe he’ll git old Mayhew
to wait on me a little while.’”</p>

<p>“Did he say that, Pole?” Floyd
had opened the note, but was looking
straight into Baker’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, he said them words, Nelson,
although he knowed I was on hand that
day when he paid off his bill in full. I
couldn’t chip in thar before his wife, an’
the Lord knows I couldn’t tell him I
had an idea what was in the note, so I
rid on as fast as I could. I had a turn
o’ meal under me an’ I tuck it off an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[Pg 452]</span>
hid it in the thicket t’other side o’ Duncan’s
big spring. I wasn’t goin’ to
carry a secret war message a-straddle
o’ two bushels o’ meal warm from the
rocks. An’ I’d bet my hat that scrap
o’ paper means battle.”</p>

<p>Floyd read the note. There was
scarcely a change in the expression of
his face or a flicker of his eyelashes as
he folded it with steady fingers and held
it in his hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, he says he has got the whole
story, Pole,” Floyd said. “He gives
me fair warning as a man of honor to
arm myself. He will be here at twelve
o’clock to the minute.”</p>

<p>“Great God!” Pole ejaculated.
“You hain’t one chance in a million to
escape with yore life. You seed how
he shot t’other day. He was excited
then—he was as calm as a rock mountain
when I seed him a while ago, an’
his ride to town will steady ’im more.
He sorter drawed down his mouth at
one corner an’ cocked up his eye, same
as to say: ‘You understand; thar
hain’t no use in upsettin’ women folks
over a necessary matter o’ this sort.’
Looky here, Nelson, old friend, some’n
has got to be done, an’ it’s got to be
done in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“It will have to be done at twelve
o’clock, anyway,” Floyd said calmly,
a grim smile almost rising to his face.
“That’s the hour he’s set.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me you are
a-goin’ to set thar like a knot on a log
an’ ’low that keen-eyed mountain
sharpshooter to step up in that door
an’ peg away at you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean that, exactly,
Pole,” Floyd smiled coldly. “A man
ought not to insult even his antagonist
that way. You see, that would be
making the offended party liable for
wilful, cold-blooded murder before the
law. No, I’ve got my gun here in the
drawer, and we’ll make a pretense at
fighting a duel, even if he downs me in
the first round.”</p>

<p>“You are a darn fool, that’s what you
are!” Pole was angry without knowing
why. “Do you mean to tell me you
are a-goin’ to put yore life up like that
to gratify a scamp like Jeff Wade?”</p>

<p>“I’d deserve to be kicked off the face
of the earth,” Floyd responded with
firmness, “if I turned tail and ran. He
seems to think I may light out; I judge
that by his setting the time a couple of
hours ahead, but I’ll give him satisfaction.
I’m built that way, Pole. There
is no use arguing about it.”</p>

<p>“My God, my God!” Pole said under
his breath. “Hush! Thar comes Mayhew.
I reckon you don’t want him
to know about it!”</p>

<p>“No, he’d be in for swearing out a
peace warrant. For all you do, don’t
let him on to it, Pole. I want to write
a letter or two, before Wade comes.
Don’t let the old man interrupt me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll feel like I’m dancin’ on yore
scaffold,” the farmer growled. “I
want my mind free to—to study.
Thar! He’s stopped to talk to Joe
Peters. Say, Nelson, I see Mel Jones
down thar talkin’ to a squad in front
o’ the door; they’ve got the’r heads
packed together as close as sardines. I
see through it now. By God, I see
through <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>“What is it you see through, Pole?”
Floyd looked up from Wade’s note,
his brow furrowed.</p>

<p>“Why, Mel’s Jeff Wade’s fust cousin;
he’s on to what’s up, an’ he’s confidin’
it to a few; it will be all over this town
in five minutes, an’ the women an’
childern will hide out to keep from
bein’ hit. Thar they come in at the
front now, an’ they are around the old
man like red ants round the body of a
black one. He’ll be on to it in a minute.
Thar, see? What did I tell you?
He’s comin’ this way. You can tell
by the old duck’s walk that he’s
excited.”</p>

<p>Floyd muttered something that
escaped Pole’s ears, and set to work
writing. Mayhew came on rapidly,
tapping his heavy cane on the floor,
his eyes glued on the placid profile
of his young partner.</p>

<p>“What’s this I hear?” he panted.
“Has Jeff Wade sent you word that
he was comin’ here to shoot you?”</p>

<p>Pole laughed out merrily, and,
stepping forward, slapped the old
merchant familiarly on the arm. “It’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[Pg 453]</span>
a joke, Mr. Mayhew!” he said. “I
put it up on Mel Jones as we rid in
town; he’s always makin’ fun o’
women fer tattlin’, an’ said I to myse’f,
said I, ‘I’ll see how deep that’s rooted
under yore hide, old chap,’ an’ so I
made that up out o’ whole cloth. I
was jest tellin’ Nelson, here, that I’d
bet a hoss to a ginger-cake that Mel
’ud not be able to keep it, an’ he
hain’t. Nelson, by George, the triflin’
skunk let it out inside o’ ten minutes,
although he swore to me he’d keep his
mouth shet. I’ll make ’im set up the
drinks on that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like such jokes!”
Mayhew fumed. “Jokes like that
and what’s at the bottom of them
don’t do a reputable house any good.
And I don’t want any more of them.
Do you understand, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I won’t do it ag’in,” answered
Pole in an almost absent-minded
tone. His eyes were now on
Floyd, and despite his assumed lightness
of manner the real condition of
things was bearing heavily on him.
Just then a rough-looking farmer, in a
suit of home-made jeans, straw hat
and shoes worn through at the bottom,
came back to them. He held in his
hand the point of a plow and looked
nervously about him.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s busy down in front,”
he said, “an’ I want to git a quarter’s
wuth o’ coffee.” His glance, full of
curiosity, was now on Floyd’s face.
“I want to stay till Wade comes,
<i>myself</i>, but my old woman’s almost
got a spasm. She says she seed enough
bloodshed durin’ the war, an’ then she
always liked Mr. Floyd. She says
she’d mighty nigh as soon see an own
brother laid out as him. Mr. Floyd
sorter done us a favor two year back
when he stood fer us on our corn
crop, an’, as fer me, why, of course,
I——”</p>

<p>“Look here, Bill Champ,” Pole
burst out in a spontaneous laugh.
“I thought you had more sense than
to swallow a joke like that. Go tell
yore old woman that I started that tale
jest fer pure fun. Nelson here an’
Wade is good friends.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, ef that’s it, that’s different,”
the farmer said. “But from
the way Mel Jones talked down thar
a body would think you fellers was
back here takin’ Mr. Floyd’s measure
fer his box. I’ll go quiet my wife.
She couldn’t talk of a thing all the way
here this mornin’ but a new dress she
was goin’ to git an’ now she’s fer hurryin’
back without even pickin’ out the
cloth.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t like this sort o’ thing,”
old Mayhew growled as the customer
moved away. “An’ I want you to
remember that, Baker.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you dry up, old man!” Pole
retorted, with a mechanical laugh.
“You’d live longer an’ enjoy life
better ef you’d joke more. Ef the
marrow o’ my bones was as sour as
yourn is I’d cut my throat or go into
the vinegar business.”</p>

<p>At this juncture Captain Duncan
came in the store and walked back to
the trio.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said cheerily.
“Say, Floyd, I’ve heard the news, and
thought if you wanted to borrow a
pair of real, good, old-fashioned dueling
pistols, why, I’ve got a pair my
father owned. They were once used
by General——”</p>

<p>“It’s all a joke, Captain,” Pole
broke in, winking at the planter and
casting a look of warning at the now
unobservant Mayhew.</p>

<p>“Oh, is <i>that</i> it?” Duncan was quick
of perception. “To tell you the truth,
I thought so, boys. Yes, yes”—he was
studying Floyd’s calm face admiringly—“yes,
it sounded to me like a
prank somebody was playing. Well, I
thought I’d go fishing this evening,
and came in to get some hooks and
lines. Fine weather, isn’t it? But the
river’s muddy. I’ll go down and pick
out some tackle.”</p>

<p>He had just gone when an old woman
wearing a cheap breakfast shawl over
her gray head, a dress of dingy solid
black calico and a pair of old, heavy
shoes approached from the door in
the rear.</p>

<p>“I got yore summons, Mr. Mayhew,”
she said in a thin, shaky voice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[Pg 454]</span>
“Peter, my husband, was so downhearted
that he wouldn’t come to
town, an’ so I had to do it. So you
are goin’ to foreclose on us? The
mule an’ cow is all on earth we’ve
got to make the crop on, and when
they are gone we will be plumb ruined.”</p>

<p>The face of the old merchant was
like carved stone.</p>

<p>“You got the goods, didn’t you,
Mrs. Stark?” he asked harshly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, nobody hain’t disputin’
the account,” she answered plaintively.</p>

<p>“And you agreed faithfully if you
didn’t pay this spring that the mule
and cow would be our property?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course! As I say, Mr.
Mayhew, I’m not blamin’ you-uns.
Thar hain’t a thing for me an’ Peter to
do but thrust ourselves on my daughter
and son-in-law over in Fannin, but
I’d rather die than go. We won’t
be welcome; they are loaded down
with childern too young to work.
So it’s settled, Mr. Mayhew—I mean
ef we drive over the mule an’ cow
thar won’t be no lawsuit?”</p>

<p>“No, there won’t be any suit. I’d
let this pass and give you more time,
Mrs. Stark, but a thing like that can’t
be kept quiet through the country, an’
there are fifty customers of ours over
your way who ’ud be running here
with some cock-and-bull story and we’d
be left high and dry with the goods
to pay for in market and nothing
to show for it. We make our rules,
Mrs. Stark, and they are clearly understood
at the time the papers are
signed.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind, Mrs. Stark, I’ll
fix that all right.” It was Nelson
Floyd who was speaking, and with
a face full of pity and tenderness he
had stepped forward and was offering
to shake hands.</p>

<p>The little woman, her lips twitching
and drawn, gave him her trembly hand,
her eyes wide open in groping wonder.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, Nelson—Mr.
Floyd. You mean——?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I’ll have your entire
account charged to me and you can
take your time about paying it—next
fall or the next, or any time it suits
you. I’ll not press you for it, if you
never pay it. I passed your place the
other day, and your crop looks very
promising. You are sure to get out of
debt this coming fall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nelson—I—I don’t know what
to do about it. Mr. Mayhew says——”</p>

<p>“But I say it’s all right,” Floyd
broke in as he laid his hand softly on
her shoulder. “Go down in front and
buy what you need to run on. I’ll assume
the risk, if there is any.”</p>

<p>Mayhew turned suddenly; his face
was white and his lip shook.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you are
going to step in and——?”</p>

<p>“Step in nothing,” Floyd said calmly.
“I hope I won’t have to remind
you, sir, of our clearly written agreement
of partnership in which it is
plainly stated that I may use my judgment
in regard to customers whenever
I wish.”</p>

<p>“You’ll ruin us—you’ll break us all
to smash, if you do this sort of thing,”
Mayhew panted. “It will upset our
whole system.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you, sir,” Floyd
answered, “but we won’t argue about
it. If you don’t intend to abide by
our agreement then say so and we will
part company.”</p>

<p>Mayhew stared in alarm for a moment,
then he said:</p>

<p>“There’s no use talking about parting.
I only want to kind of hold you
in check. You get your sympathies
stirred up and make plunges sometimes
when you ought to act with a clear
head. You say the crop looks well;
then, it’s all right. Go ahead, Mrs.
Stark. Anything Nelson does is agreeable
to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s mighty good of you
both,” the old woman said, wiping
tears of joy from her eyes. “No, I
won’t buy anything today. I’ll ride
out to the farm as quick as I can and
tell Peter the good news. He’s mighty
nigh out of his senses about it.”</p>

<p>Mayhew followed her down into the
store. It was as if he were ashamed
to meet the quizzical look which Pole
Baker had fixed upon him. He had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[Pg 455]</span>
sooner turned his back than Pole faced
Floyd and asked: “How does she stand
by your ticker?”</p>

<p>Floyd looked at his watch. “It’s a
quarter-past eleven,” he said.</p>

<p>“The hell it is!” Pole went to the
back door and looked out at the dreary
stable-yard and barn. He stood there
for several minutes in deep thought.
Then he seemed to make up his mind
on something that was troubling him,
for he suddenly thrust his hand into
his hip-pocket and drew out a revolver
and rapidly twirled the cylinder with
his heavy thumb.</p>

<p>“Yes, I ’lowed I’d swore off from
shootin’ scrapes,” he mused; “but I
shore have to git in this ’un. I’d never
look Sally an’ the childern in the face
agin ef I was to stand still an’ let that
dead shot kill the best friend me an’
them ever had. No, Poley, old boy,
you’ve got to enlist this mornin’, an’
thar hain’t no two ways about it. I’d
take a drink on that, but a feller’s
aim hain’t wuth a dang when he sees
double.”</p>

<p>His attention was suddenly attracted
to Floyd, who had left his stool and
was putting a revolver into the pocket
of his sack coat. Pole shoved his own
cautiously back into his pocket and
went to his friend’s side.</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do now?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I have just thought of something
that ought to be attended to,” was
Floyd’s answer. “Is Mel Jones still
down there?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I see ’im now through the
left-hand window,” said Pole. “Do
you want to see ’im?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Floyd moved in the direction
indicated and Pole wonderingly
followed. Outside on the pavement
at the corner of the store Mel Jones
stood talking to a group of eager listeners.
He stopped when he saw Floyd,
and looked in the opposite direction,
but in a calm voice the young merchant
called him.</p>

<p>“Mel, may I see you a minute?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.” The face of the gaunt
farmer fell as he came forward, his
eyes shifting uneasily.</p>

<p>“I got a message from Jeff Wade
just now,” said Floyd.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you? Is that so?” the
fellow exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes; he says he has a private matter
to settle with me, and says he’ll be
here at the store at twelve. Now, as
you see, there are a good many people
standing around—women and children,
and somebody might get hurt or frightened.
You know where Price’s spring
is, down behind the old brick yard?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I know where it is, Floyd.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will do me a favor if you
will ride out to Wade’s and tell him I’ll
meet him there. He could reach it
without coming through town, and
we’d escape a lot of prying people who
would be in the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Jones, his
strong face lighting up. “Yes, I’ll go
tell ’im. I’m glad to see that you are a
man o’ backbone, Floyd. Some ’lowed
you’d throw up the sponge an’ leave fer
parts unknown, but Jeff’s got to tackle
the rale stuff. I kin see that, Floyd.
Minnie Wade raised a lots o’ devilment,
an’ my wife says whatever rumors
spread about her was her own fault.
But Jeff cayn’t be expected to see it
through a woman’s eyes. I wish you
was goin’ to meet a man that wasn’t
sech a dead shot. I seed Jeff knock a
squirrel out of a high tree with his six-shooter
that three men had missed with
rifles.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to take care of myself, Mel.
But you’d better hurry up and get to
him before he starts to town.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll git ’im all right,” said the
farmer, and he went out to the hitching-rack,
jumped on his horse and
galloped away.</p>

<p>The group Jones had been talking to
now drew near, their eyes and mouths
open.</p>

<p>“It’s all off, boys,” Pole said, with
one of his inscrutable laughs. “Explanations
an’ apologies has been exchanged—no
gore today. It was a big
mistake all round.”</p>

<p>This version soon spread, and a sigh
of relief went up from everybody. Fifteen
minutes passed. Pole was standing
in the front door of the store,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[Pg 456]</span>
cautiously watching Floyd, who had
gone back to his desk to write a letter.
Suddenly Pole missed him from his
place.</p>

<p>“He’s tryin’ to give me the slip,”
Pole said. “He’s gone out at the back
door and has made fer the spring.
Well, he kin <i>think</i> he’s throwed old
Pole off, but he hain’t by a jugful.
I know now which road Jeff Wade will
come by, an’ I’ll see that skunk before
Nelson does or no prayers hain’t answered.”</p>

<p>He went out to the hitching-rack,
mounted, and, waving his hand to the
few bystanders who were eying him
curiously, rode away, his long legs
swinging back and forth from the
flanks of his horse. A quarter of a
mile outside of the village he came to
a portion of the road leading to Jeff
Wade’s house that was densely shaded,
and there he drew rein and dismounted.</p>

<p>“Thar hain’t no other way fer ’im to
come,” he said, “an’ he’s my meat—that
is, unless the damn fool kin be
fetched to reason.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p>There was a quilting party at Porter’s
that day. Cynthia had invited
some of her friends to help her, and the
quilt, a big square of colored scraps,
more or less artistically arranged in
stars, crescents and floral wreaths, occupied
the centre of the sitting-room.
It was stitched to a frame of four
smooth wooden bars, which were held
together at the corners by pegs driven
into gimlet holes and which rested on
the backs of four chairs. The workers
sat on two sides of it and stitched,
with upward and downward strokes,
toward the centre, the quilt being
rolled up as the work progressed.</p>

<p>Hattie Mayhew was there, Kitty
Welborn and two or three others. As
usual they were teasing Cynthia about
the young preacher.</p>

<p>“I know she’s the apple of his eye,”
laughed Kitty Welborn. “He really
can’t, as you said the other night, keep
from looking at her during preaching.
I noticed it particularly one Sunday
not long ago and told Matt Digby that
I’d be sure to get religion if a man
bored it into me with eyes like his.”</p>

<p>“I certainly would go up to the
mourners’ bench every time he called
up repentant sinners,” said Hattie Mayhew.
“I went up once while he was
exhorting and he turned me over to Sister
Perdue, that snaggle-toothed old
maid. He didn’t even offer his hand.”</p>

<p>Cynthia said nothing, but she smiled
good-naturedly as she rose from her
chair and went to the side of the quilt
near the crudely screened fireplace to
see that the work was rolled evenly on
the frame. While thus engaged her
father came into the room, vigorously
fanning himself with his old slouch hat.
The girls knew he had been to the village,
and all asked eagerly if he had
brought them any letters.</p>

<p>“No, I clean forgot to go to the
office,” he made slow answer as he
threw himself into a big armchair with
a rawhide bottom, near a window on
the shaded side of the house.</p>

<p>“Why, father,” his daughter chided
him, “you promised the girls faithfully
to call at the office. I think that
was very neglectful of you when you
knew they would be here to dinner.”</p>

<p>“And he usually has a good memory,”
spoke up Mrs. Porter, appearing
in the doorway leading to the dining-room
and kitchen. She was rolling
flakes of dough from her lank hands
and glanced at her husband reprovingly.
“Nathan, what <i>did</i> you go and
do that way for, when you knew Cynthia
was trying to make her friends
pass a pleasant day?”</p>

<p>“Well, I clean forgot it,” Porter
said, quite undisturbed. “To tell you
the truth, thar was so much excitement
on all hands, with this un runnin’
in with fresh news, an’ that un sayin’
that maybe it was all a false alarm,
that the post-office plumb slipped out
o’ my head. Huh, I hain’t thought
post-office once sence I left here! I
don’t know whether I could ’a’ got
in thar anyway, fer the Postmaster hisse’f
was runnin’ round like a camp-meetin’
chicken with its head cut off.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[Pg 457]</span>
Besides, I tell you, gals, I made up
my mind to hit the grit. I never was
much of a hand to want to see wholesale
bloodshed. Moreover, I’ve heard
of many a spectator a-gittin’ shot in
the arms an’ legs or some vital spot.
No, I sorter thought I’d come on.
Mandy, have you seen anything o’ my
fly-flap? When company comes you
an’ Cynthia jest try yoreselves on seein’
how many things you kin put out o’
place, an’ I’m gittin’ sick an’ tired
o’——”</p>

<p>“Nathan, what’s going on in town?”
broke in Mrs. Porter. “What are you
talking about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s goin’ on <i>now</i>,”
Porter drawled out as he slapped at a
fly on his bald pate with an angry
hand. “I say I don’t know what’s
goin’ on <i>now</i>; but I know what was
jest gittin’ ready to go on. I reckon
the coroner’s goin’ on with the inquest
ef he ain’t afeared of an ambush. Jeff
Wade—” Porter suddenly bethought
himself of something, and he rose,
passed through the composite and
palpable stare of the whole room and
went to the clock on the mantelpiece
and opened it. “Thar!” he said impatiently.
“I wonder what hole or
crack you-uns have stuck my chawin’
tobacco in. I put it right in the corner
of this clock, right under the turpentine
bottle.”</p>

<p>“There’s your fool tobacco!” Mrs.
Porter exclaimed, running forward and
taking the dark plug from beneath the
clock. “Fill your mouth with it;
maybe it will unlock your jaw. What
is the trouble at Springtown?”</p>

<p>“I was jest startin’ to tell you,” said
Porter, diving into his capacious trousers
pocket for his knife and slowly
opening the blade with his long thumbnail.
“You see, Jeff Wade has at last
got wind o’ all that gab about Minnie
an’ Nelson Floyd, an’ he sent a war-cry
by Pole Baker on hossback as fast
as Pole could clip it to tell Floyd to
arm an’ be ready at exactly twelve
o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p>“I knew it would come,” said Mrs.
Porter, a combination of finality and
resignation in her harsh voice. “I
knew Jeff Wade wasn’t going to allow
that talk to go on.” She was
looking at her daughter, who, white
and wide-eyed, stood motionless behind
Hattie Mayhew’s chair. For a
moment no one spoke, though instinctively
the general glance went to
Cynthia, who, feeling it, turned to the
window looking out upon the porch,
and stood with her back to the room.
Mrs. Porter broke the silence, her words
directed to her daughter.</p>

<p>“Jeff Wade will kill that man if he
was fool enough to wait and meet him.
Do you think Floyd waited, Nathan?”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t wait,” was Porter’s
answer. “The plucky chap went ’im
one better; he sent word by Mel Jones
to tell Wade that it would be indecent
to have a rumpus like that in town on a
Saturday, when so many women an’
childern was settin’ round in bullet-range,
an’ so, if it was agreeable he’d
ruther have it in the open place at
Price’s spring. Mel passed me as
he was goin’ to Jeff with that word.
It’s nearly one o’clock now, an’ it’s
my candid opinion publicly expressed
that Nelson Floyd has gone to meet
a higher Power. I didn’t want to be
hauled up at court as a witness, an’
so, as I say, I hit the grit. I’ve been
tied up in other folks’s matters before
this, an’ the court don’t allow enough
fer witness fees to tempt me to set an’
listen to them long-winded lawyers
talk fer a whole week on a stretch.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” exclaimed Hattie
Mayhew. “I’m right sorry for him.
He was so handsome and sweet-natured.
He had faults, but they
may have been due to the hard life he
had when he was a child. I must say I
have always been sorry for him; he had
the saddest look out of the eyes of any
human being I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“And he knew how to use his eyes,
too,” was the sting Mrs. Porter added
to this charitable comment as her
sharp gaze still rested on her daughter.</p>

<p>There was a sound at the window.
Cynthia, with unsteady hands, was
trying to raise the sash. She finally
succeeded in doing this and placing
the wooden prop under it. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[Pg 458]</span>
a steely look in her eyes and her features
were set, her face pale.</p>

<p>“It’s very warm in here!” they
heard her say. “There isn’t a bit of
draught in the room. It’s that hot
cook stove, mother; I will—I——”</p>

<p>She had turned and walked from the
room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Porter sighed as she looked
after the departing form.</p>

<p>“Did you notice her face, girls?”
she asked. “It was as white as death
itself. She looked as if she was about
to faint. It’s all this talk about Floyd.
Well, they <i>were</i> friends. I tried to
get her to stop receiving his attentions,
but she thought she knew better.
Well, he has got his deserts, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“And all on account of the talk
about that silly Minnie Wade!” cried
Kitty Welborn, “when you know as
well as I do, Mrs. Porter, that Thad
Pelham—” The speaker glanced at
Nathan Porter and paused.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t let up on yore
hen-cackle on my account,” that
blunt worthy made haste to say. “I’ll
go out an’ look at my new hogs. You
gals are out fer a day o’ pleasure, an’
I wouldn’t interfere with the workin’
of yore jaws fer a purty.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Porter didn’t remain to hear
Kitty Welborn finish her observation,
but followed her daughter.</p>

<p>In the next room, which was the
dining-room, an old woman sat at a
window. She was dressed in dingy
black calico, her snowy hair brushed
smoothly down over a white wrinkled
brow, and was fanning herself slowly
with a turkey-feather fan. She had
Mrs. Porter’s features and thinness of
frame.</p>

<p>“Mother,” Mrs. Porter said, pausing
before her, “didn’t Cynthia come in
here just now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she did,” replied the old
woman. “She <i>did</i>. And I just want
to know, Mandy, what you all have
been saying to her? I want to know,
I say?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t been saying anything
to her as I know of,” said the farmer’s
wife in slow, studious surprise.</p>

<p>“I know you have, I say, I know
you <i>have</i>!” The withered hand holding
the fan quivered in excitement. “I
know you have, for I can always tell
when that poor child is worried. I
heard a little of it, too, but not all.
I heard them mention Hillhouse’s
name. I tell you, I am not going to
sit still and let a whole pack of addle-pated
women tease as good a girl as
Cynthia is plumb to death.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they were troubling
her,” Mrs. Porter said, her face drawn
in thought, her mind elsewhere.</p>

<p>“I know they <i>were</i>,” the old woman
insisted. “She may have hidden it
in there before you all, but when she
came in here just now she stopped
right near me and looked me full in the
face, and never since she was a little
baby have I seen such an odd look
in her eyes. They looked like they
were about to burst with tears.
She saw me looking at her, and she
come up behind me and laid her face
down against my neck. She quivered
all over, and then she said, ‘Oh,
Granny! Oh, Granny!’ and then she
straightened up and went right out at
that door into the yard. I tell you,
it’s got to let up. She sha’n’t have the
life deviled out of her. If she don’t
want to marry that preacher, she
don’t have to. As for me, I’d rather
have married any sort of man on earth
when I was young than a long-legged,
straight-faced preacher.”</p>

<p>“You say she went out in the yard?”
said Mrs. Porter absently. “I wonder
what she went out there for.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Porter went to the door and
looked out. There was a clothesline
stretched between two apple trees nearby,
and Cynthia stood at it taking
down a tablecloth. She turned with
it in her arms and came to her mother.</p>

<p>“I just remembered,” she said,
“that there isn’t a clean cloth for the
table. Mother, the iron is hot on the
stove. You go back to the girls and
I’ll smooth this out and set the table.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the two met. Mrs.
Porter took a deep breath. “All
right,” she said. “I’ll go back to the
company, but I’ve got something to
say, and then I’m done for good.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[Pg 459]</span>
I want to say that I’m glad a daughter
of mine has got the proper pride and
spunk you have. I see you are not
going to make a goose of yourself
before visitors, and I’m proud of you.
You are the right sort—especially
after he’s acted in the scandalous
way he has and—and laid you, even
as good a girl as you, liable to be talked
about for keeping company with
him.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes sank. Something
seemed to rise and struggle up within
her, for her breast heaved and her
shoulders quivered convulsively.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix the cloth,” she said in a low,
forced voice, “and then I’ll set the
table and call you.”</p>

<p>“All right”; Mrs. Porter was turning
away. “I’ll try to keep them entertained
till you come back.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p>Beneath a big oak Pole stood holding
his bridle-rein and waiting, his earnest
gaze on the long road leading to
Jeff Wade’s farm. Suddenly he descried
a cloud of dust far ahead and he
chuckled.</p>

<p>“He’s certainly on time,” he mused.
“He must ’a’ had his hoss ready out
in the thicket. Mel made good time,
too. The dern devil is thirstin’ fer
bloodshed. Mel’s that sort. By gum,
that hain’t Wade; it’s Mel hisse’f, an’
he’s certainly layin’ the lash to his
animal.”</p>

<p>In a gallop Jones bore down on him,
riding as wildly as a cowboy, his broad
hat in one hand, a heavy switch in the
other. He drew rein when he recognized
Baker.</p>

<p>“Did you deliver that message?”
Pole questioned.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I finally got him alone;
his wife seems to suspicion some’n, and
she stuck to ’im like a leech. She’s a
jealous woman, Pole, an’ I don’t know
but what she kinder thought Jeff was
up to some o’ his old shines. He was
a sorter tough nut before he married,
you know, an’ a man like that will do
to watch.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did he say?” Pole
asked.</p>

<p>“Why, he said ‘all hunkydory.’
The spring plan ketched him jest right.
He said that one thing—o’ bloodyin’ up
the main street in town—had bothered
him more than anything else. He admired
it in Floyd, too. Jeff said, ‘By
gum! fer a town dude that feller’s got
more backbone than I expected. He’s
a foe wuth meetin’, an’ I reckon killin’
’im won’t be sech a terrible disgrace as
I was afeared it mought be.’”</p>

<p>“But whar are you headin’ fer in
sech a rush?” Pole asked.</p>

<p>Jones laughed as he put his hat carefully
on his shaggy head and pressed
the broad brims up on the sides and to
a point in front. “Why, Pole,” he
answered, “to tell you the truth, I am
headed fer that thar spring. I’m goin’
to acknowledge to you that, as long as
I’ve lived in this world, I hain’t never
been on hand at a shootin’ affair.
Mighty nigh every man I know has seed
oodlin’s of ’em, but my luck’s been
agin me. About the most excitin’
thing I ever attended was a chicken
fight, and so I determined to see this
un. I know a big rock jest above that
spring, and I’m a-goin’ to git thar in
plenty o’ time. You let me git kivered
all but my eyes, an’ I’ll run the resk o’
gettin’ hit from thar up. Whar you
makin’ fer, Pole?”</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I’m on the way home,
Mel. I seed the biggest rattlesnake
run across this road jest now I ever laid
eyes on. I got down to settle his hash,
but I didn’t have anything to hit ’im
with, an’ I’m done stompin’ at them
fellers sence Tobe Baker, my cousin,
over at Hillbend, got bliffed on the
knee.”</p>

<p>“Well, so long!” Mel laughed. “I’ll
hunt rattlesnakes some other time.
Are you plumb shore you hain’t got the
jimmies agin’, Pole? Take my advice
an’ don’t tell about seein’ snakes; it
sets folks to thinkin’. Why, I seed
you once in broad daylight when you
swore black spiders was playin’ sweepstakes
on yore shirt front.”</p>

<p>“So long, Mel!” Pole smiled and
waved his hand. He made a fair pretense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[Pg 460]</span>
at getting ready to mount as Mel
galloped away in a cloud of dust. The
horseman was scarcely out of sight
when a pair of fine black horses drawing
a buggy came into view. The vehicle
contained Captain Duncan and his
daughter Evelyn. She was a delicate,
rather pretty girl of nineteen or twenty,
and she nodded pleasantly to Pole as
her father stopped his horses.</p>

<p>“You are sure that thing’s off, are
you, Baker?” the planter said, with a
genial smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Captain.” Pole had his
eyes on the young lady and had taken
off his hat, and stood awkwardly swinging
it against the baggy knees of his
rough trousers.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m very glad,” Duncan said.
“I know you told some of the crowd
back at the store that it had been settled,
but I didn’t know whether it was
reliable or not.”</p>

<p>Pole’s glance shifted between plain
truth and Evelyn Duncan’s refined
face for a moment, and then he
nodded. “Oh, yes, it was all a mistake,
Captain. Reports get out, you
know; and nothin’ hain’t as bad as gossip
is after it’s crawled through a hundred
mouths an’ over a hundred wigglin’
tongues.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad, as I say,” the
planter said as he jerked his reins and
spoke to his horses.</p>

<p>As he whirled away Pole growled.
“Damned ef I hain’t a-makin’ a regular
signpost out o’ myself,” he mused,
“an’ lyin’ to beat the Dutch. Ef that
dern fool don’t come on purty soon
he’ll—but thar he is now, comin’ on
with a swoop—looks like his hoss is
about to run from under ’im, his dern
legs is so long. Now, looky here, Pole
Baker, Esquire, hog-thief an’ liar, you
are up agin about the most serious
proposition you ever tackled, an’ ef you
don’t mind what you are about you’ll
have cold feet inside o’ ten minutes by
the clock. You’ve set in to carry this
thing through or die in the attempt,
an’ time’s precious. The fust thing is
to stop the blamed whelp; you cayn’t
reason with a man that’s flyin’ through
the air like he’s shot out of a gun, an’
Jeff Wade’s a-goin’ to be the devil to
halt. He’s got the smell o’ blood, an’
that works on a mad man jest like it
does on a bloodhound—he’s a-goin’ to
run down some’n. The only thing in
God’s world that’ll stop a man o’ that
sort is to insult ’im, an’ I reckon I’ll
have that to do in this case.”</p>

<p>Jeff Wade was riding rapidly. Just
before he reached Pole he drew out his
big silver open-faced watch and looked
at it. He wore no coat and had on a
gray flannel shirt open at the neck.
Round his waist he wore a wide leather
belt, from which, on his right side, protruded
the glittering butt of a revolver
of unusual size and length of barrel.
Suddenly Pole led his own horse round,
until the animal stood directly across
the narrow road, rendering it impossible
for the approaching rider to pass
at the speed he was going.</p>

<p>“Hold on thar, Jeff!” Pole held up
his hand. “Whar away? The mail
hack hain’t in yet. I’ve jest left town.”</p>

<p>“I hain’t goin’ after no mail!” Wade
said, his lips tight, a fixed stare in his
big, earnest eyes. “I’m headed fer
Price’s spring. I’m goin’ to put a few
holes in that thar Nelson Floyd, ef I git
the drap on him ’fore he does on me.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Pole ejaculated; “no, you
hain’t a-goin’ to see him, nuther; that
is, not till me’n you’ve had a talk, Jeff
Wade. You seem in a hurry, but thar’s
a matter betwixt me an’ you that’s got
to be attended to.”</p>

<p>“What the hell do you mean?” Wade
demanded, a stare of irritated astonishment
dawning in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, I mean that Nelson Floyd
is a friend o’ mine, an’ he ain’t a-goin’
to be shot down like a dog by a man
that could hit a nickel a hundred yards
away nine times out o’ ten. You an’
me’s close together, an’ I reckon
chances ’ud be somewhar about equal.
I hain’t a brag shot, but I could hit a
pouch as big as yourn is about as easy
as you could me.”</p>

<p>“You—you—by God, do you mean
to take this matter up?”</p>

<p>Jeff Wade slid off his horse and stood
facing Pole.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, Jeff; that is, unless you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[Pg 461]</span>
listen to common sense. That’s what
I’m here fer. I’m a-goin’ to stuff reason
into you ef I have to make a new
hole to put it in at. You are a-goin’
entirely too fast to live in an enlightened
Christian age, an’ I’m here to call
a halt. I’ve got some things to tell you.
They are a-goin’ to hurt like pullin’
eye-teeth, an’ you may draw yore gun
before I’m through, but I’m goin’ to
make a try at it.”</p>

<p>“What the——?”</p>

<p>“Hold on, hold on, hold on, Jeff!”
Pole raised a warning hand. “Keep
that paw off’n that cannon in yore
belt or thar’ll be a war right here before
you hear my proclamation of the
terms we kin both live by. Jeff, I am
yore neighbor an’ friend. I love you
mighty nigh like a brother, an’ I’m
here to tell you that, with all yore
grit an’ good qualities, you are makin’
a bellowin’ jackass o’ yoreself. An’ ef
I let you put through yore present
plans, you’ll weep in repentance fer it
till you are let down in yore soggy
grave. Thar’s two sides to every question,
an’ you are lookin’ only at yore
side o’ this un. You cayn’t tell how
sorry I am about havin’ to take this
step. I’ve been a friend to yore entire
family—to yore brothers, an’ yore
old daddy when he was alive. I mighty
nigh swore a lie down in Atlanta to
keep <i>him</i> out o’ limbo when he was
arrested fer moonshinin’.”</p>

<p>“I know all that!” growled Wade;
“but God——”</p>

<p>“Hold yore taters now, an’ listen!
You mought as well take yore mind
off’n that spring. You hain’t a-goin’
to git at Nelson Floyd without you
walk over my dead body—an’ thar’s
no efs an’ ands about that. You try
to mount that hoss, an’ I’ll kill you ef
it’s in my power. I say I’ve got some’n
to tell you that you’ll wish you’d listened
to. I know some’n about Minnie
that will put a new color on this whole
nasty business; an’ when you know
it, ef you kill Nelson Floyd in cold
blood, the law will jerk that stiff neck
o’ yourn—jerk it till it’s limber.”</p>

<p>“You say you know some’n about
Minnie?” The gaunt hand which till
now had hovered over the butt of the
big revolver hung down straight. He
stood staring, his lip hanging loose, a
sudden droop of indecision upon him.</p>

<p>“I know this much, Jeff,” Pole said,
less sharply. “I know you are not
after the fust offender agin yore family
honor, an’ when I prove <i>that</i> to you I
don’t believe you’ll look at it the
same.”</p>

<p>“You say—you say——?”</p>

<p>“Listen now, Jeff, an’ don’t fly off
the handle at a well-wisher sayin’ what
he thinks has to be said in justice to
all concerned. The truth is, you never
seed Minnie like other folks has all
along. You seed ’er grow up an’ she
was yore pet. To you she was a regular
angel; but other folks has knowed all
along, Jeff, that she was born with a
sorter light nature. Women folks,
with the’r keen eyes, has knowed that
ever since she got out o’ short dresses.
Even yore own wife has said behind yore
back a heap on this line that she was
afeared to say to you. Not a soul has
dared to talk plain to you, an’ even <i>I</i>
wouldn’t do it except in this case o’
life an’ death.”</p>

<p>Wade shook back his long, coarse
hair. He was panting like a tired dog.
“I don’t believe a damn word of what
you are a-sayin’!” he muttered, “an’
I’ll make you prove it, by God, or I’ll
have yore life-blood!”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Jeff,” Pole said
gently. “I’m not goin’ to threaten any
more. Believe me or not, <i>but listen</i>!
You remember when Thad Pelham
went off to Mexico a year or so ago?”</p>

<p>Wade made no reply, but there was
a look of dawning comprehension in
his great, blearing eyes.</p>

<p>“I see you remember that,” Pole
went on. “Well, you know, too, that
he was goin’ with Minnie a lot about
that time—takin’ her buggy-ridin’ an’
to meetin’. He was a devil in pants;
his whole family was bad. The men
in it wouldn’t go in the gate o’ heaven
ef a woman was winkin’ at ’em on the
outside. Well, Thad started fer Mexico
one day, an’ at the same time Minnie
went on a visit to yore brother
Joe in Calhoun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[Pg 462]</span></p>

<p>“She went thar a year ago,” Wade
said, “fer I bought ’er ticket at Parley.”</p>

<p>“She told <i>you</i> she went to Calhoun.”
Pole’s eyes were mercifully averted. “I
met her an’ Thad in Atlanta.”</p>

<p>Wade caught his breath. He shook
from head to foot as with a chill.</p>

<p>“You say—Pole, you say——?”</p>

<p>Pole pulled at his mustache and
looked down.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon they wasn’t down
thar to attend a Sunday-school convention,
Jeff—they didn’t have that
look to me. But I was so worried fer
fear I mought be doin’ a woman injustice
in my mind that, after they left
me—to make sure, I went in the office
o’ the hotel an’ made sure.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Wade put out his hand
and laid it heavily on Pole’s shoulder.
“Looky here, Baker,” he said, “if you
are lying to me, I——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, <i>hold on</i>, Jeff Wade!”
Pole broke in sternly. “Whenever
you use words like them you smile!
So fer, this has been a friendly talk,
as I see it; but you begin to intimate
that I’m a liar, an’ I’ll try my best to
make you chaw the statement. You’re
excited, but you mustn’t go too fur.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want the truth, by God,
I want the truth!”</p>

<p>“Well, you are a-gittin’ it, with
the measure runnin’ over,” Pole said,
“an’ that ought to satisfy any reasonable
man.”</p>

<p>“So you think then, that Nelson
Floyd never done any—any o’ the
things folks says he did—that ’twas
jest report?”</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t here to say that,
nuther,” said Pole most diplomatically.
“But la me! what a stark, ravin’
fool you was about to make o’ yoreself,
Jeff!” Pole went on. “You started
to do this thing today on yore sister’s
account, when by doin’ it you would
bust up her home an’ make her life
miserable.”</p>

<p>“You mean——?”</p>

<p>“I mean that Joe Mitchell, that’s
been dead stuck on Minnie sence she
was a little gal, set up to her an’ proposed
marriage. They got engaged
an’ then every old snaggle-toothed
busybody in these mountains set in to
try to bust it up by totin’ tales about
Floyd an’ others to ’im. As fast as one
would come Minnie’d kill it, an’ show
Joe what a foolish thing it was to listen
to gossip, an’ Joe finally told ’em
all to go to thunder, an’ they was
married an’ moved on his farm in
Texas. From all accounts they are
doin’ well an’ are happy; but la me;
they wouldn’t be that a-way long ef
you’d ’a’ shot Nelson Floyd this
mornin’.”</p>

<p>“You say they wouldn’t, Pole?”</p>

<p>“Huh, I reckon <i>you</i> wouldn’t dance
a jig an’ sing alleluia ef you was
to pick up a newspaper this mornin’
an’ read in type a foot long that yore
wife’s brother, in another state, had
laid a man out stiff as a board fer
some’n that folks said had tuck place
some time back betwixt the man an’
her.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Wade’s glance was now on
Pole’s face. “Huh, I reckon you are
right, Pole, I reckon you are right.
I wasn’t thinkin’ about that.”</p>

<p>“Thar was <i>another</i> duty you wasn’t
a-thinkin’ about, too,” Pole said.
“An’ that is yore duty to yore wife
an’ childern that would be throwed
helpless on the world ef this thing
had ’a’ come off today.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see <i>that</i>, anyway,”
said Wade dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> do, Jeff. You see, ef you’d
’a’ gone on an’ killed Floyd, after
I halted you, I’d ’a’ been a witness
agin you, an’ I’d ’a’ had to testify that
I told you, in so many words, whar the
<i>rale</i> blame laid, an’ no jury alive
would ’a’ spared yore neck.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s so,” Wade admitted.
“Well, I guess I’ll go back,
Pole. I won’t go any further with it.
I promise you not to molest that
scamp. I’ll not trade any more at his
shebang, an’ I’ll avoid ’im all I kin, but
I’ll not kill ’im as I intended.”</p>

<p>“Now, you’re a-talkin’ with a clear
head an’ a clean tongue.” Pole drew
a breath of relief and stood silent as
Wade drew his horse around, put
his foot into the heavy wooden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[Pg 463]</span>
stirrup and mounted. Pole said nothing
until Wade had ridden several
paces homeward, then he called out to
him, and beckoned him back with his
hand, going to meet him, leading his
horse.</p>

<p>“I just thought o’ some’n else,
Jeff—some’n I want to say. I reckon
I wouldn’t sleep sound tonight, or
think of anything the rest o’ the day,
ef I don’t git it off my mind.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Pole?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t feel right about
callin’ you to halt so rough jest now,
an’ talkin’ about shootin’ holes in you
an’ the like, fer I hain’t nothin’ agin
you, Jeff. In fact, I’m yore friend
now more than I ever was in my life.
I feel fer you <i>’way down inside o’ me</i>.
The look on yore face cuts me as keen
as a knife. I—I reckon, Jeff, that you
sorter feel like—like yore little sister’s
dead, don’t you?”</p>

<p>The rough face looking down from
the horse filled. “Like she was dead
an’ buried, Pole,” Wade answered.</p>

<p>“Well, Jeff”—Pole’s voice was husky—“don’t
you ever think o’ what I said
a while ago about shootin’. Jeff, I
jest did that to git yore attention.
You mought ’a’ blazed away at me, but
I’ll be derned ef I believe I could ’a’
cocked or pulled trigger on you to ’a’
saved my soul.”</p>

<p>“Same here, old neighbor,” said
Wade as he wiped his eyes on his
shirt sleeve. “I wouldn’t ’a’ tuck
them words from no other man on the
face o’ God’s green globe.”</p>

<p>When Wade had ridden slowly
away Pole mounted his own horse.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll go tell Nelson that the
danger is over,” he said. Suddenly
he reined his horse in and sat looking
thoughtfully at the ground.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” he finally decided.
“He kin set thar an’ wonder what’s up.
I was in a hair’s breadth o’ the grave,
about to leave a sweet wife an’ kids
to starvation jest beca’se of him. No,
Nelsy, old boy, you look death in the
eye fer a while; it won’t do you no
harm.”</p>

<p>And Pole Baker rode to the thicket,
where he had hidden his bag of cornmeal
that morning, and took it home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>A Phase of the Money Problem
Bankers Dare Not Discuss</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY ALBERT GRIFFIN<br />
<i>Author of “The Keynote: Substitute Honest Money for Fictitious Credit,”
“The Hocus Pocus Money Boon”</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">BECAUSE of limited space, this
paper contains little more than
principles, facts and conclusions,
without argument—and the subject
is considered from the practical
man’s standpoint rather than that of
the theorizer. The one monetary
proposition to which all schools agree
is that “money is the medium of exchange.”
To be used as such is its
one and only universally admitted purpose—and
no other characteristic is
essential. No matter of what it consists,
whatever is <i>willingly</i> used by
people as their medium of exchange is
money, and should be so recognized by
everyone—but unfortunately, the
greater part of it is not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[Pg 464]</span></p>

<p>There is honest money and dishonest
money. None is strictly honest that
is not as good as the best—for exchange
purposes. Ideal money has the
same exchange value at all times, and
everywhere—and the best money is
that which is nearest the ideal. Without
discussing what it should consist
of, I hold that the material ought to
be more substantial than a banker’s
“confidence” that he will always be
able to pay the most of his debts with
mere debits and credits. As business
cannot be done without money, and
as each person needs enough of it to
enable him to exchange his services and
products for the services and products
of others, it goes without saying that
there ought to be enough to supply
each and all liberally—and that no
man, or set of men, should be allowed
to affect materially this supply for
selfish purposes.</p>

<p>To most people, the soundness of
the “quantitative theory” of money is
self-evident. Concisely stated, it is
that, whenever the quantity of money
in circulation increases faster than the
exchanges to be made with it, commodities
tend to rise in price—and
<i>vice versa</i>—which is but the application
to money of the inexorable law
of supply and demand. While the
soundness of this theory is generally
admitted, every business man knows
that sometimes facts seem to disprove
it. In 1890, when the failure of Baring
Brothers so nearly precipitated a
panic throughout this country, the
quantity of visible money in circulation
was increasing; and the same fact
was true in April, 1893, when the proceedings
agreed upon at the conference
between Secretary Carlisle and prominent
New York bankers precipitated
a fearful panic on the next business
day—and yet, in both of these cases,
the apparent conflict resulted from the
suppression of a part of the facts.</p>

<p>Now for the explanation: In comparing
the size or weight of two masses
the whole of each must be contrasted
with the whole of the other, and in
comparing two actively operating
forces all of the factors of each must
be considered together, without regard
to names. But, strange to say, three-fourths
of what is being used and paid
for as money, and which really does the
work of money, and does nothing else,
is denied the right of being called
money by some doctrinaires—and also
by bankers, when talking to the public.
Although between May 1 and October
1, 1903, the volume of metallic and
paper money actually increased, this
something which had been doing the
work of money was contracted $500,000,000
in New York City alone—but
as it was not called money its relation
to the results was not generally recognized.</p>

<p>Deposit banks are little more than
clearing-houses; and the laws permit
their owners to pay nine-tenths of their
debts with money literally made by
themselves—out of nothing—which
they coolly call “liquid capital,” or
“bank credit,” although it is neither
capital nor credit. The real nature
and far-reaching effects of this modern
practice are not clearly understood by
one in twenty even of the bankers
themselves—and none of them dares
discuss it publicly. The most of those
that do not fully understand it <i>feel</i> that
there is something wrong about it; and
those that do understand it know that,
if people once begin to study “the
system,” they will demand radical
changes in it—or its entire abolition.</p>

<p>Government reports for 1904 put
the volume of metallic and paper money
then in existence at $2,829,273,316—or
$31.16 per capita; and the Comptroller’s
report shows that the banks
whose reports he consolidated were
earning interest on more than $6,278,000,000
of money that had no existence—or
$76.47 per capita. This stuff is
what, for a dozen years, I have called
“hocus pocus money.” It consists
of nothing but, in the language of Professor
Sidgwick, rows of figures on bank
books; and yet it affects business,
prices and values, exactly as that
amount of real money would. Invisible,
intangible and mythical, it is
nevertheless very real—filling the land
with prosperity, joy and song today,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[Pg 465]</span>
and disaster, tears and despair tomorrow,
it is the most potent economic
power ever known. Business men gladly
accept it as money. <i>The courts treat it
as money.</i> And, although, for technical
reasons, most political economists do
not do so, I insist that, to all intents and
purposes, it is money, and should be
so recognized. Indeed, until this shall
be done, it will be impossible to frame
a monetary system that will always
work equitably and beneficently.</p>

<p>Between 1896 and 1904, as officially
reported, the increase in the volume of
visible money was, in millions, $1,322,000,000—or
$9.75 per capita; but the
quantity of hocus pocus money in use
increased $5,275,000,000—or $43.42
per capita—the quantity of both kinds
then actually in use being $107.63 per
capita. This shows that four-fifths of
the increase in the medium of exchange
consists merely of the right
given favored people to draw checks
on banks to pay which no real money
has been deposited.</p>

<p>In 1888, 5,866 bank reports showed
that they were then collecting interest
on $3.41 for each dollar of their capital
available for “commercial loans”; but
last year’s reports of the 13,772 national,
state and private banks and
loan and trust companies show that
their aggregate capital (including surplus,
undivided profits and bank-notes)
amounted to $2,927,000,000. This was
everything their owners had put into
their business, and of it $2,743,000,000
had been paid out for bonds, stocks,
real estate, real estate mortgages, etc.,
leaving only $183,000,000 available for
“commercial loans.” And yet their
“loans and discounts” aggregated $6,431,000,000,
or $35.07 of “commercial
loans” for every dollar of their not
otherwise invested capital. If this is
not “<i>getting something for nothing</i>” on
a stupendous scale, I should like to
know what would be so considered.</p>

<p>Remember, that these figures include
all of the reported banks. Individual
cases are incomparably worse. On
December 2, 1899, the National City
Bank, of New York City (the principal
of the several hundred Standard Oil
banks), had $6,709,216 of capital, surplus,
etc.; its investments of capital
aggregated $27,270,738; its available
capital was therefore $20,561,519 <i>less
than nothing</i>; and yet it was then actually
earning interest on $60,906,034 of
“loans and discounts,” making $81,467,553
of hocus pocus money. And
remember further that, to make people
more dependent on banks for this kind
of money with which to do business,
the volume of real money is kept as
small as possible. This is the real reason
why bankers engineered the contraction
of the currency after the war
and the demonetization of silver. But
for them no class of business men
would have consented to either of those
economic crimes.</p>

<p>Here are a few more important facts:</p>

<p>1. Interest has to be paid <i>to the
banks</i> on every dollar of hocus pocus
money as long as it lives.</p>

<p>2. It lives, on an average, only about
two months.</p>

<p>3. Every payment of a note or draft
extinguishes the hocus pocus money
involved in that transaction and contracts
its volume that much, making
it the most constantly and wildly fluctuating
money ever known.</p>

<p>4. Whenever, for any reason, bankers
fear a demand for an unusual
amount of real money they make fewer
“loans” and “call in” some that are
outstanding, which destroys that part
of the “liquid capital” that was in actual
use as a medium of exchange and
cramps the money market.</p>

<p>5. Bankers sometimes do these
things unnecessarily, for the purpose
of making a “bear market”; but it is
also true that business conditions sometimes
compel them to do so, as was the
case in 1857 and 1873.</p>

<p>6. If the banks had on hand as much
money as they reported (which is not
always true), they, in 1888, owed
$6.01 for every dollar they reported;
and last year the proportion was $9.98
to $1. The sixty-two national banks
in the central reserve cities are required
to keep nearly 25 per cent. of
their deposits on hand in cash; the
285 in the other reserve cities only 12½<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[Pg 466]</span>
per cent., and the 5,065 in non-reserve
cities only 6 per cent. State bank requirements
vary greatly, private banks
and loan and trust companies are
under few or no restrictions, and the
loan and trust companies keep only
about 2 per cent.</p>

<p>7. Less than one-tenth of the “deposits”
in banks are real money—the
others being mere promises of the
banks to pay money to those who have
bought (with notes) the right to draw
checks against them—and it is simply
impossible to so regulate the system
as to prevent it from frequently working
disastrously.</p>

<p>8. Contracting the volume of any
kind of money that is willingly accepted
by producers always causes suffering.
Indeed, modern conditions require a
large annual increase in the volume of
money; and, with an insufficient supply
of real money, it is not now possible
to prevent the use of hocus pocus
money.</p>

<p>9. It is well known that, when their
interests seem to require it, great bankers
defy the laws made to restrain
them.</p>

<p>10. There ought to be places in which
people can deposit money and know it
will remain there until checked out by
themselves.</p>

<p>For ten years I have called attention
to the fact that there never has been,
in this or any other country, a widespread
commercial panic that was not
caused <i>solely</i> by the sudden contraction
of the hocus pocus money then
being used by banks, and have challenged
contradiction; but this challenge
has never been accepted. Hocus
pocus money <i>is the one and only seriously
disturbing factor that has always
and everywhere preceded</i> these catastrophes.
Other causes aggravate
them, but, with it eliminated, panics
would be impossible, because it is this
sudden, absolute destruction of the
bank’s manufactured “liquid capital,”
used by so many as their medium of
exchange, which paralyzes their business
operations and makes “the bottom
drop out of the market,” as it
were.</p>

<p>No words are lurid enough to portray
properly the terrible evils and personal
suffering that its use causes, and
I submit that it is time people should
begin to consider earnestly the question,
Had we not better insist that
some kind of real money shall be substituted
for the unreal now in use,
and thus permanently remove the
cause that so often produces such baleful
results? Conditions were never so
favorable for doing this as they are
now. No election is pending; the two
great parties are lazily talking on similar
platforms; all financial organs insist
that the country is prospering; and,
although people are deeply stirred, they
are not excited.</p>

<p>The use of hocus pocus money, and
its evil results, have increased steadily
from the beginning of the deposit banking
system. From time to time methods
change, but every change increases
the power and profits of the few—and
the helplessness of the many. The
gravest of these changes began to be
felt about a decade ago. Leading
bankers had always used some of their
hocus pocus money for the promotion
of their own schemes, but from that
time the Rockefellers, Morgans and
others have been systematically getting
control of the principal deposit banking
institutions, and using, not only a
rapidly increasing proportion of their
depositors’ real money, but also more
of the hocus pocus money made possible
by those deposits. Mr. Lawson and
others have shown how this has been
done on a gigantic scale, in specific
cases, and of all unfossilized, sober-minded
people I ask, can 999 business
men afford to permit the thousandth
man to continue appropriating
to his own use the hocus pocus money
their own deposits have made possible—and,
in addition, help him to keep
the volume of real money ruinously
small? Indeed, would it not be idiotic
folly to do so?</p>

<p>To me the problem appears to be:
How can hocus pocus money be safely
eliminated—or so restricted as to be
harmless—and the quantity of real
money so increased that all will, at all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[Pg 467]</span>
times, be able to exchange their products
and services; that commercial
panics and long periods of business depression
will become impossible; and
that a few men in each community
will no longer have the power to
ruin all who refuse to obey their
orders?</p>

<p>Space will not permit me to tell here
how this can be done, but I will say
that, fortunately, this greatest and
most overshadowing of the economic
problems that confront humanity is
the easiest of all to solve; that, as
bankers are the controlling spirits in—or
back of—nearly all trusts and combines,
settling the money problems
will make the solution of all the others
easier; that it can be done without
wronging anyone, or imposing additional
burdens on the people; and that
economic and social conditions would
improve during the entire process.</p>

<p>But suppose that some of my conclusions
may not be correct, does not
the experience of the last hundred years
prove, beyond controversy, that our
banking and financial systems must be
radically unsound in some very important
particulars? And, if so, should
we not insist upon their prompt improvement—or
the substitution of better
ones?</p>

<p>Every business man knows that, if
the banks were required to keep larger
reserves always on hand, they would be
safer places of deposit. And they are
equally well aware that the more real
money there is in circulation the more
prosperous and happy are the people.
And the vitally important question is,
not how far or how fast shall we go,
but, shall we not begin to move steadily
and determinedly in the direction
of less danger and more permanent
prosperity?</p>

<a name="A_Leaf_From_a_Protective_Tariff" id="A_Leaf_From_a_Protective_Tariff">&nbsp;</a>
<h2 class="nobreak"><i>A Leaf From a Protective Tariff
Catechism</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">(OVERHEARD IN A PROTECTIVE KINDERGARTEN)</p>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY JOEL BENTON</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Q. WHAT is Protection?</p>

<p>A. It is placing a duty upon
foreign goods, of many kinds,
to enable American makers of similar
goods who “plead the baby act” to
get higher prices for those goods than
they otherwise would. It is compelling
all the people to pay taxes to a few
of the people.</p>

<p>Q. Why is this favor given to the
few people?</p>

<p>A. On account of the fact that they
pay so much higher wages than foreign
manufacturers do and to compel
them to pay still higher wages.</p>

<p>Q. Is this necessary?</p>

<p>A. It is very necessary to the Republican
Party; for it gives it an issue
and its chief cause for existence. When
it saw accomplished, by the fortune of
war, the freedom of the slave, what
could be more natural and glorious than
its ready espousal of anti-freedom for
commerce?</p>

<p>Q. Are “protective” duties always
just equal to the difference between our
wages and foreign wages?</p>

<p>A. That is what our argument implies;
and, if our argument is true, that
is all we can ask. But how is a noble
army of patriots to be maintained, and
how can election expenses be met if we
do not—in our tariff—treble and more
than quadruple this difference often?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[Pg 468]</span></p>

<p>Q. Are high wages given by our manufacturers
without an equivalent advantage
in return?</p>

<p>A. It is true of wages, as of other
things—that they are ordinarily worth
their price, so that our <i>high-priced</i> labor
is really labor of <i>low cost</i>. But it
is a mighty convenient subterfuge to
keep this fact out of sight and by this
means hoodwink the poor laborer for
his vote.</p>

<p>Q. Do manufacturers keep a lobby
at Washington for securing a tariff that
makes them pay <i>high</i> wages and yet sell
their goods at <i>low</i> prices?</p>

<p>A. That is what we very often say,
substantially.</p>

<p>Q. Can our manufacturers sell goods
abroad?</p>

<p>A. They do very largely over other
tariff walls, and bear the expense of
transportation and insurance and secure
handsome profits. But the question
is too delicate a one to enlarge
upon.</p>

<p>Q. Does Mexico have a protective
tariff?</p>

<p>A. She does. The plea for it there
is that it is a defense against our <i>high-priced</i>
labor. The Mexican peons work
for very <i>low prices</i> and at a more than
correspondingly <i>high cost</i>. It is one
of the beauties of Protection that,
whether labor costs little or much, you
can plead for it for either reason.</p>

<p>Q. Does Protection help Agriculture?</p>

<p>A. It puts a tariff on hay, grain,
potatoes, eggs, etc. Very little of any
of these commodities are imported by
us. When they are imported to any
extent the farmers are the chief buyers,
as they are of peas, beans and
other seeds for planting. By paying
the duty on all these things themselves
they not only feel certain there is a
duty, but they have the satisfaction
of knowing they are not forgotten in
the great “protective” scheme.</p>

<p>Q. Why is Protection called the
American System?</p>

<p>A. This was the question Daniel
Webster asked Henry Clay, who so
named it, when they were not in accord
upon the tariff. Webster was
puzzled by the name, for he knew the
system was European and medieval;
but “American” sounds well and makes
us consistent in berating foreign things
and ideas.</p>

<p>Q. How does Protection help commerce?</p>

<p>A. Commerce is so foreign we don’t
need to help it. So we let it go to the
miserable foreigners—what we permit
to exist. It is really better to pay
the two hundred million dollars we pay
them yearly to carry our goods than
to let that amount of money pervert
our high and noble doctrine.</p>

<p>Q. What is meant by having the
tariff “revised by its friends”?</p>

<p>A. That, as the English say, is a
good “half-crown phrase.” But its
real meaning is to oppose revising the
tariff in any way whatever. Several
elections have been carried by this
plea, and we are still working it for all
it is worth. Of course no one goes to
have his shoes mended to a shoemaker
who is in favor of their holes and lack
of heels, and no one selects depredators
of hen-roosts to watch chicken thieves;
but we must not defer to ordinary rules
when “the noble citadel of Protection”
is in danger.</p>

<p>Q. Is it understood that to change
the tariff injures business?</p>

<p>A. We always say that, and charge
to Free Trade the calamity that ensues.</p>

<p>Q. Suppose someone tells us there
has been no Free Trade, and if Free
Trade existed there would be no tariff
to change, and therefore no injury from
tariff changes?</p>

<p>A. Then is the time to look wise and
say little. For our main object is to
make Protection the source of all good
and Free Trade the cause of all evil.</p>

<p>Q. How did it happen that, when
hides were freed from duty in 1872—and
even by the McKinley bill—they
were taxed under the Dingley bill?</p>

<p>A. Well—but—let’s see. Why
shouldn’t hides enjoy prosperity?
It’s certain the big cattle dealers, who
use the Government pastures without
cost, profit by the duty, while we can
claim it helps the farmers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[Pg 469]</span></p>

<p>Q. Why are works of art tariff?</p>

<p>A. Not because the artists ask for
Protection. They’re such curious people
that they all oppose it. So we
choose to be benevolent to them in
spite of their eccentric behavior.</p>

<p>Q. What other peculiar tricks have
our Protection wise men?</p>

<p>A. A pretty good one is to say that
we are not tied up to any present or
definite “schedules,” but to remember
constantly that, if any change is made
in the tariff, it must be one that goes up
and never one that goes down. It was
a great mistake for Garfield to say, “I
believe in a Protection that leads to
Free Trade.”</p>

<p>Q. What is Reciprocity?</p>

<p>A. It is—well, suppose you should
build a bonfire and then pour water on
it, or build a levee on the Mississippi
and then punch holes through it. It
is a part of our consistent scheme.
Blaine knew, and who can dispute
Blaine?</p>

<p>Q. What is Free Trade?</p>

<p>A. It is any scale of duties for any
purpose that is the least bit lower than
the Dingley bill. Everything that preceded
that “bravest tariff ever made”
is Free Trade. If some day Protection
should climb to loftier heights, those
who should oppose it by the lower
Dingley bill would be Free Traders.</p>

<p>Here a boy, who got surreptitiously into
the class, asked this unauthorized question:</p>

<p>Q. But you say this country has
prospered under almost unbroken Protection.
Now, since everything tariff-like
before the Dingley bill is either
Free Trade or Free Tradish, why is
not all our prosperity up to the passage
of that owing to Free Trade?</p>

<p>A. A boy cannot be expected to understand
the flexibility of our nomenclature
or the grandeur of a great principle.
We are struggling to help
“American Industries.” Must so little
a thing as mere consistency stand between
us and our friends? Boys should
be seen and not heard.</p>

<p>Q. What is meant by American Industries?</p>

<p>A. Mainly manufactures. Of course
these, and all protected interests, represent
only from 5 to 8 per cent. of
the real and total industries of the
country. But they are the ones having
large capital and power—the ones
that can hire attorneys and maintain
a lobby, and that have abundant “fat
for frying” when important elections
are at hand. Doesn’t “American Industries”
sound well, if you only
mouth it right, and roll it from the
editorial pen and the platform often
enough?</p>

<p>Q. How about the industries that
are left out, or get merely nominal
Protection?</p>

<p>A. The question is quite irrelevant.
What more can they ask than to live in
a “protected” country and be saved
from Free Trade?</p>

<p>Q. Why do we protect woolen goods,
and then de-protect manufacturers by
“protecting” wool?</p>

<p>A. For the same reason that the boy
cuts off a shoestring on one end and
ties the cut-off piece on the other end.
It amuses the boy and very likely helps
us to get rid sooner of a foreign shoestring.</p>

<p>Q. Mention the value of Protection
to American shipping.</p>

<p>A. It doesn’t hurt it; for, by its aid
and the help of our navigation laws,
there is none to hurt. The way to have
ships is first to make it impossible for
us to build them, and then give enough
subsidy to make it possible. Now you
see the little joker and now you don’t.
Didn’t President Harrison almost shed
tears when he hauled up the American
flag on a steamer rescued from a foreign
register? It isn’t possible to have
Protection and have everything, but
isn’t it lovely to make things impossible
at much expense and then
make them possible at more expense,
and at last call in a President and have
a melodramatic time about it? Besides
all this, it employs money and
promotes labor.</p>

<p>Q. Does Protection make wages <i>high</i>
and goods manufactured <i>low</i>?</p>

<p>A. That is what our philosophers
maintain. Manufacturers are so anxious
to exist here, and it is so necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[Pg 470]</span>
that we should have them, that
they must pay high for their labor and
sell its product low. To avoid paying
but a little for labor, and to be prevented
from selling their goods at high
prices, they are even willing to maintain
expensive lobbies at Washington
and contribute large sums for electing
Protectionists to Congress, to say
nothing of “hypnotizing” doubtful or
opposing senators.</p>

<p>Q. Can the first part of the above
answer be really so?</p>

<p>A. It must be. A Protection journal
had for its headlines on a Protection
article the other day the statement that
for many years Protection had done for
manufacturers just this: It has made
the wages they give <i>high</i> and the prices
they get <i>low</i>, and so they would be
splendidly off if it were not for the
shadow of that wicked Wilson bill.</p>

<p>Q. Does prosperity then consist in
enlarging your expenses and reducing
your income?</p>

<p>A. It always does in Wonderland
and Topsy-Turvydom, and under Protection.</p>

<p>Q. But do not “protected” manufacturers
import laborers?</p>

<p>A. Manufacturers are held by us to
be benevolent. Of course they import
laborers, in order that there may be
more here to get the benefit of our
higher wages.</p>

<p>Q. How about invention under Protection?</p>

<p>A. It isn’t necessary. So long as
you can run the old ramshackle machinery,
and be defended by the Government,
you are saved the trouble of
inventing newer and better methods.
Some way might possibly be found
if Yankee wit were once to be let loose,
whereby we could compete with other
nations in our manufactures, so that
everybody would admit it, and then
what would become of Protection? Remember
constantly it isn’t the welfare
of the people that is paramount; it is
Protection.</p>

<p>Q. Protection being so much more
necessary than free government, free
soil, free speech, and so cherubically
philanthropic when compared with the
dreadfulness of British Free Trade, the
question arises, How shall we maintain
its propaganda?</p>

<p>A. We must first of all be very
careful to say that Free Trade is
British. Of course Magna Charta, including
trial by jury and many other
good things, are British too, but we
mustn’t lose so good a stock argument.
It is true, also, that England has prospered
far more under Free Trade than
she ever did under Protection. But
the glorious Blaine accounted for that
by saying that Free Trade might be
good for England, but it must never
come here. In other words, two and
two make five or six over there, but
here they fail to make four.</p>

<p>Q. What next must we do?</p>

<p>A. As our country has been very
prosperous from its commencement,
and we have had more or less Protection
within that period, the best way
is to say that all this has happened
“under Protection.” It has happened
<i>under</i> other things, too, both good and
evil, because it couldn’t happen <i>over</i>
them. But never let us forget that it
was all caused by Protection. The
very slight fact that our country was
most prosperous when we had very low
revenue duties is purely accidental and
irrelevant. In Mr. Blaine’s history of
his career in Congress he described the
period of our greatest prosperity. But
there was no election in view then, and
he was careless enough to say that this
period coincided with what is called the
period of the Free Trade tariff of 1846.
It was a dreadful mistake, because the
statement was altogether too true, and
Protection has no use for that which
is merely true.</p>

<p>Q. There are other arguments, are
there not?</p>

<p>A. A very decisive one is to call Free
Trade a theory. For it is a theory of
the Creator, who seemed to favor the
idea of commerce along with civilization.
But He, of course, left something
for men to find out. The Chinese
found out in the twelfth century
that a big wall around their country
would keep off nations that were savage
and hostile; but the Republican<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[Pg 471]</span>
Party have gone the Chinese one better
and have walled off trade. No
doubt some college Free Trader will
ask you ironically if it is really the
man who walks on his feet who is the
theorist and innovator, and if the one
who walks on stilts, and who tries to
get everyone else on stilts, and who
thinks it is a mistake that people were
not born already stilted—as nations
should have been already walled—is
not one. But levity like this is what a
great cause must not notice.</p>

<p>Q. What more must be said?</p>

<p>A. We must take pains to compare
the United States with some foreign
country. As we have already shown
that everything good that has occurred
here is wholly owing to Protection,
we must take some foreign country and
charge all that is bad there, such as
the costly armies, the despotic or
kingly rule, the dense population, the
illiteracy, etcetera, to Free Trade.
There are no really Free Trade countries
in Europe except England, and
possibly Belgium. They are protective
in part. But they are foreign, and
that is sufficient for the argument.
Only put the excess of our benefits
over theirs to the benefit of Protection,
and all will be right.</p>

<p>Q. What shall we say about cheapness
and dearness?</p>

<p>A. Didn’t the Apostle Paul say we
must be all things to all men? If we
do seem to oppose somewhat the solidarity
of humanity, we meet in our
arguments a variety of mental difficulties.
Our Apostle Harrison went
for dearness by not wanting to find a
cheap coat, for fear he should find a
cheap man under it. Another Apostle
thought “cheap and nasty go together.”
At the final period of a Presidential
election, however, it is better
to say that Protection makes things
cheap, and our editors almost always
take that cue. To be sure, if cheapness
were our intention, Protection could not
be established, and we could not cry
out against “cheap pauper labor.” The
arguments must therefore be shuffled—and
cheap and dear must sometimes
be taken and at other times denied.
The question is more or less of a crux,
but it is the beauty of the noble doctrine
of Protection that all trivialities
of this sort it majestically sweeps away.
Not being amenable to any of the laws
of human reason, it is not disturbed by
such trifles as truth and consistency.</p>

<p>Q. But can’t we say the foreigner
pays the tax?</p>

<p>A. We certainly can and we do. But
this argument needs very cautious
handling. Sometimes duties are collected
through the Post-Office, when the
cat is let out of the bag and the duty
comes directly to the man to whom the
package is addressed. If he asks to
have it charged to the foreign country
his goods came from, even a Republican
postmaster will sometimes laugh at
him. Such perverse incidents as this
are what Artemus Ward might call
“in-fe-lick-et-us”—very.</p>

<p>Q. How was it when Congress removed
the tax from sugar?</p>

<p>A. Well—sugar isn’t everything. It
won’t do to be too one-sided. We
could not resist telling the public then
that we had removed a heavy burden
from <i>its</i> shoulders. We really hated
to tax the foreigners so much.</p>

<p>Q. What can be argued about the
terms Protection and Free Trade?</p>

<p>A. Argument is superfluous here.
The very word Protection is an assumption
that meets all our requirements.
It forecloses argument and shuts off
dispute. Who doesn’t wish to be “protected”?
And how charming it sounds
to say we are protected from burglars,
from enemies and from the horrors of
trade—that is, trade with a foreigner.
It must be always understood that if
you could stand near the Canada or
Mexico boundary and make a good
bargain on the other side—say, the purchase
of a horse for fifty dollars less
than you could purchase him in your
own country—you would inflict upon
yourself and your country just so much
loss. But if you buy the horse here at
a price higher by fifty dollars, or over
a tariff, with the fifty dollars added,
you enrich both yourself and your
country. On this doctrine, which is
our fundamental one, we must and can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[Pg 472]</span>
stake everything, and against it the
frothy waves of Free Trade will beat
in vain.</p>

<p>Q. Why is not Free Trade also a
felicitous term?</p>

<p>A. Things that are in themselves
good, and that are made free and abundant,
are, we must admit, generally to
be approved. Abundant health or
abundant friendship or abundant
money we have not yet thought it wise
to consider objectionable. But there
are exceptions to all rules. Abundant
trade—or Free Trade—which is trade
done voluntarily by shrewd and sane
men in order to procure abundant
money, is different. To have it otherwise
would upset our whole system of
philosophy. What was this land of
the free made for, if its main purpose
were not to put shackles on trade?
What we want is to eat our own cake
and have it too; to sell everything we
can to foreigners and buy nothing from
them, and finally to get fat by stewing
in our own juice.</p>

<p>The term Free Trade—to refer to the
original question—is now so asphyxiated
by us, by our contempt of it, that
it suggests a Pandora’s box of horrors
the moment we mention it. To speak
of it in this contemptuous way is really
one of our strong arguments. What
we want is to scream it out as a horror,
to make it a bugbear. It is like telling
children of some dreadful bogy lying
in wait for them in the dark, or like
Dr. Johnson’s experiment with the
fishwoman of Billingsgate, when he
called her a hypothenuse, a triangle, a
parallelopipedon, and several other
mathematical things of which she had
not the faintest knowledge and which
she consequently supposed were very
bad.</p>

<p>No, whatever else we do, let us stick
to our insistent and persistent screech
against Free Trade.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Monopoly; The Power Behind the Trust</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY JOSEPH DANA MILLER</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HOW comes it that a power
in its unimpeded operations
beneficent—namely, the force
or forces of combination or co-operation—becomes
under certain conditions
so injurious to modern industry?
Why is a union of two factories or
many factories, of two companies or
many companies, a signal to the community
of anticipated extortion? And
why should the development of natural
laws—those of combination and co-operation—provoke
a public demand
for regulation, and those who avail
themselves of these operations be
deemed amenable to punishment?</p>

<p>We may grant that a perfected
combination which should succeed in
forestalling any given commodity
would be criminal. The law from its
very beginnings has so regarded all
such attempts. It is conceivable that,
under certain conditions, a mere agreement
between individuals might perfect
a combination clearly within the
provision of the law compelling its
forcible dissolution. But this is not
conceivable under modern conditions
where wide distribution of capital and
free labor exists. Law, indeed, may
create such monopolies, which it may
by popular demand be called upon to
destroy, undoing with one hand what
it has done with the other. State-created
monopolies have existed often
in history—as notably in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth—but because these
have been created by direct act they
have been exceedingly unpopular.
So, in periods of greater public intelligence,
and where the people exercise
larger powers of government, it became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[Pg 473]</span>
necessary to accomplish the
same result by indirect means, by
putting into operation some general
law under which monopoly could find
a shelter, and the secret sources of
which could not be so easily traced.</p>

<p>For, contrary to the almost universal
opinion, monopoly is weak. It
demands protection. And from what
does it demand protection? From the
all-powerful natural law of competition.
The curious Socialist notion
that competition leads to monopoly
is true only in the sense that monopoly,
seeing how powerless it is when
threatened by the forces of competition,
seeks the protection of such laws
as it can secure, or which already
exist, for the suppression of competition.
And this brings us to the conclusion
which is unavoidable that there
are no monopolies save law-created
monopolies.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a></p>

<p>If this seem a novel proposition to
the reader I will ask him not to grow
impatient, for the demonstration will
grow upon him as he reflects. It will
seem novel, for if true all the laws and
statutes for the regulation of combinations
are so much waste of time
and paper and the hours of legislatures
and courts. In the acceptance of such
explanation of the trust problem must
go the rejection of many proposed
remedies, among them the much-lauded
one of “publicity.” While
publicity is always to be commended
and sought for in public or semi-public
matters, it does not appear that laws
enforcing publicity upon purely private
industrial combinations are
founded upon equity. Nor is it likely
that publicity will assure us the possession
of knowledge beyond what we
already have through the work of independent
investigators. Nor is it
probable that enforced publicity will
elicit impartial truth. This proposition
is of a piece with the punitive theory
in the treatment of the problem, a
theory which has already led the
people far astray. Men shrink instinctively
from such stringent regulation,
and this is a true index of the
moral relation, if we may so speak, of
this problem to legislation. But because
they will not think clearly they
return to the proposition of legal interposition.</p>

<p>Along with the remedy of “publicity”
must go all laws, existing or
proposed, limiting capitalization or
stock watering. Beyond the fact that
such laws would often force capitalization
below the earning capacity—which
is no unfair basis of capitalization—it
must be said that the evils
of stock watering are largely imaginary.
It is true that over-capitalization
may conceal from the public the
real extent of monopoly profits, and
is for this purpose, if for no other,
often resorted to. But this of itself
ought to constitute no valid reason for
drastic legislation. Investors ought
to be left free to take their own risks,
and speculative ventures ought to be
left free to fix their own capitalization,
for otherwise perfectly legitimate, if
largely speculative, business interests
may be made to suffer injuriously to
the interests of the community. But
laying aside for the time all considerations
of this kind, stock watering is
only a symptom—a sign that monopolistic
powers, and not legitimate business
interests, are being capitalized.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2">[2]</a></p>

<p>High capitalization, it is sometimes
said, tends to increase price. It does
offer temptation to increase of price,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[Pg 474]</span>
but nothing can put it within the
power of combinations to increase
price save the forces of monopoly.
This power you do not increase or
decrease by adding to the numbers
of the counters, the considerations
governing which are purely those of the
stock-gambling fraternity.</p>

<p>National licensing of corporations to
do business—a remedy proposed by
Mr. Bryan and adopted by President
Roosevelt—must also be dismissed.
Obviously if the state has endowed
corporations and armed them with
letters of marque by authority of
which they may prey upon commerce,
it is the height of absurdity to ignore
this feature of the question with talk
about licensing them. In a very real
sense they are already licensed, for
it must be repeated that combinations
do not create the monopoly, but merely
avail themselves of the monopolistic
powers created by society through acts
of Government.</p>

<p>Of necessity all such laws must fail.
This, it is scarcely necessary to say,
has been the universal experience.
And from future legislation no more
is to be hoped than from past legislation,
however well intentioned.</p>

<p>The reason why all this anti-trust
legislation is futile is because, having
created monopoly privileges, Government
has appealed to the natural
instincts of all men to seek these opportunities
and benefits. Such laws
are attempts to give effective form to
the public’s foolish anathemas against
impulses shared by everybody, and
are therefore as futile as the Pope’s
bull against the comet. When we
understand that these great trusts
are monopolies that Government has
made, we will realize why it is that
Government cannot unmake them by
any other process than by removing
the causes of their creation.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3">[3]</a> Books
prescribing such anti-trust legislation
may continue to cumber the libraries
of our lawyers, and streams of statutes
may continue to pour from the lawmaking
bodies of states and Nation,
but these will be either positively
harmful or wholly harmless, never
effective.</p>

<p>We are, indeed, “fooling” with natural
laws, and we can do so only at
our peril. The law of competition and
the law of co-operation or combination
are what they have often been
called, the centripetal and centrifugal
forces of social economics. Competition
is often a painful but really a
merciful process; it weeds out the
useless and the inefficient; selects
unerringly its business leaders; destroys,
but where it destroys builds
up; rescues from the mass the individuals
and processes most fitted
to survive, and out of chaos brings
order. It replaces obsolete with more
perfect organization, and where such
organization becomes unwieldy it replaces
organization with individuals,
reverting to the earlier type of industry.
Thus the country store is
succeeded by the store in which is
sold but one line of goods, and this is
succeeded by the mammoth type of
country store, the great city’s department
store; and the development
of the last named type seems again to
revert to the second—viz., a congeries
of stores in which each is distinct from
the other, each attaining a reputation
for competitive excellence in one line
of goods, thus illustrating in the retail
trade the interplay of the forces of
competition and combination.</p>

<p>Just as there is a limit fixed to the
bounds of competition, so there is a
limit to the bounds of combination.
The maximum of combination and
the maximum of efficiency are not the
same. There is a point in the progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[Pg 475]</span>
of combination beyond which it
does not, or would not naturally advance—and
that is when it reaches
the maximum of efficiency. It seems
very likely that the element of monopoly
in society today forces combination
far beyond the point of the
most efficient co-operation.</p>

<p>These natural laws may not be
“regulated.” Such laws are not for
regulation, but for obedience. We
may impede, we may interrupt their
operation, but only to our injury.
The most we can do is to regulate our
institution by these laws, as we trim
a sail to the wind and tides; we do
not attempt to “regulate” wind and
tides; and these laws of co-operation
and competition are of the same order—natural
laws which to disobey is to
be destroyed.</p>

<p>We hear much superficial talk about
“the wastes of competition.” The
Socialists play into the hands of the
trust apologists who defend them on
the ground that competition leads to
waste. Beyond the fact that competition
has never yet been fully tried,
that it has never yet been wholly free,
and that such waste as it entails is
inseparable from the natural process
which weeds out the incompetent, the
antedated and the unskilled—a process
of which the waste is but incidental
to the conservation—is that these
combinations do not seek primarily to
escape the waste of competition so
much as to avail themselves of those
artificial laws which prevent competition
from doing its perfect work.</p>

<p>The term expressing the opposite
of competition is not combination,
but monopoly. Professor Jenks, in
his work, “The Trust Problem,” falls
into this error when he speaks of
combinations in the retail trade as
overcoming the “friction” of competition,
instancing associations of hardware
dealers, druggists, etc. Here,
he says, we have an element of combination
from which he assumes the
element of competition has been eliminated.
But his error is in the analogy
he seeks to establish between such
agreements from which the element of
competition cannot be expelled, and
agreements which are based upon the
control of some special privilege created
by law, and of which the great
railroad and industrial trusts are examples,
and which people have in
mind when they talk of the “trust
problem.”</p>

<p>Clearly no monopoly exists nor can
be made to exist in the retail trade.
Agreements may be made, but they
will be broken; and the fact that
they can be broken by isolated individuals
who can thus separate themselves
from the combination, and by
their separation cause it to dissolve, is
proof that the monopoly element does
not exist. For the monopoly element
in the possession of the great trusts is
the potent weapon with which the combinations
can compel the recalcitrant
member to return, or beat him into
starvation. From mere agreements in
the retail trade, such as Professor Jenks
instances, the primary element of monopoly
being absent, desertions are
fatal, and for this reason such combinations
are never effective as means for
extortion, though they do often arrest
the sacrifices of keenly competing retailers.
And the illicit intrusion of such
examples is a favorite trick of the trust
apologist, who, when the evils of the
trust are pointed out, grows righteously
indignant over the right of men to
combine—which nobody seriously disputes—or
points out with superfluous
wealth of illustration how combination
effects the cheapening of production—which
nobody ever really denies. For
the same reason labor unions cannot be
considered as effective monopolies—though
the trust apologist does not
forget them in his special pleas—for the
reason that they possess no effective
legal privilege.</p>

<p>But to avoid a possible misunderstanding
let us now answer a query
which may have risen in the mind of the
reader. Is competition or combination
the beneficent law of industry?
Both; for one is the complement of the
other. They exist together, and together
they effect the industrial progress
of the world. But monopoly is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[Pg 476]</span>
the negation of both, since further combination
or co-operation is no longer
possible where monopoly is complete.
And where there is competition there
will be combination, healthy, rational,
continuous, and competition will determine
its development and direction.
The defense of the trust based upon
the economic benefits resulting from
the elimination of the unskilled is a
defense of the principle of combination
present under free competition,
and is in no sense a defense of monopoly
of which what we know as the “trust”
is the manifestation. Such discussion,
together with much talk of the wastes
of competition, which helps to swell
so many pretentious works on the
trust problem, is so much irrelevant
“padding.”</p>

<p>That the trusts avail themselves of
all possible economies in production
has often been urged in their defense.
Certainly such economies are not needed
to secure a monopoly in possession,
nor does it seem that the greatest incentives
to their adoption are present.
The sacrifice of inventions rather than
their use by these great monopolies
is proof that they do much to prevent
such economies. A monopoly can be
induced to accept only with difficulty
improved devices which under the
spur of competition it would gladly
avail itself of. Thus in the Post-Office,
which is a monopoly, though a
Government monopoly, improvements
are introduced only with the greatest
difficulty.</p>

<p>If combination can of itself effect
monopoly, why are huge sums set aside
by these great corporations to influence
legislation? Why are contributions
made to the campaign funds of the two
great parties? Is it not because these
combinations seek to perpetuate their
monopolistic privileges? It may be
said that it is contributed to effect
the defeat of “strike bills.” But what
would a business partnership, not in
some way dependent upon previously
existing legislation, care about “strike
bills”? Why does the American Sugar
Refining Company (according to the
testimony of Mr. Havemeyer) contribute
in some states to the Republican
campaign fund, and in other states to
the Democratic campaign fund?</p>

<p>As an example of the kind of defense
urged by the trust apologists here is a
work entitled, “The Trust; Its Book,”
containing articles from the pens of
Charles R. Flint, James J. Hill, S. C. T.
Dodd, Francis B. Thurber, and others.
It is a plea of “confession and avoidance.”
The authors fight shy of even
the hated term monopoly, and content
themselves with defending the right of
combination. Not one of them appears
to think that the popular outcry
against trusts is founded on anything
but utter ignorance; and they therefore
devote themselves to showing the
advantages of large scale production—as
if that were the question. All
this seems purely disingenuous. It is
hardly conceivable that men who know
so well the effects of monopoly, who
know how potent has been the use by
combination of existing laws securing
the possession of special privileges,
should write this way from any other
motive than to becloud the issue.
We can acquit them of intentional deception
far less readily than the professors
of political economy. The latter
may be at once exonerated, since
it is incredible that men who have become
involved in the self-created subtleties
of modern economics should retain
sufficient clearness of comprehension
to see anything in its proper relation.</p>

<p>If it be true that there are no monopolies
save law-created monopolies, it
only remains for the state to undo the
work it has done. The means by which
the state, consciously or unconsciously,
has fostered monopolies may be
removed, and a new, and up to this
time untried, method for remedying
the evils of trusts be set in motion.</p>

<p>Before we can agree to this, however,
we must understand what monopoly
is. Briefly stated, it is the power to
charge more than a competitive price
for a commodity or service. This
power can be permanently secured by
the favor of Government, and in no
other way. An agreement between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[Pg 477]</span>
individuals cannot accomplish it, since
such agreements, even if they include
all individuals in interest, which is impossible,
or at all events inconceivable,
would infallibly be broken. The only
way such agreements may be made
effective is for Government to make
powerless, or nearly so, the potential
competitive elements or individuals in
interest. This it does in several ways,
or to be explicit, chiefly in three ways.</p>

<p>By Land Laws,</p>

<p>Tax Laws,</p>

<p>Laws Regulating (or that fail to
regulate) the use of the steam highways
of the country.</p>

<p>I know of no other source of monopoly
unless it be our patent laws.
But these being—originally at least—rewards
of invention, the injury results
from their misuse.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4">[4]</a> Even the misuse
of patent laws is not one of the chief
potent influences in the perpetuation
of monopoly. But without, in most
cases, adding to the power of monopoly,
which derives its strength from
other causes, it puts in the hands of
the great combinations the power to
arrest progress. The value to society
of an invention is in its use. Under
present misuse of patents, inventions
are held out of use and are often
bought up and destroyed for the purpose
of depriving competitors of the
use of like improvements, or because
such inventions would often reduce the
machinery in present use to the value
of old iron. Clearly, if industrial progress
is to be made to yield its full results,
some change in our patent laws
is imperatively called for. Were the
law of competition allowed to work
freely, the use of such inventions, even
under present patent laws, would be
determined largely by the law of self-preservation.
For the sources we have
indicated are also the sources to a degree
of the patent monopoly. In a
competitive market for the use of an
invention the inventor would be less
likely to part with his invention, even
under the present patent system.
Where the bidding is artificially restricted
the inventor sells at a disadvantage.
Monopoly has the inventor
at its mercy. But however this may
be, nothing less than the free use of an
invention to everyone willing to pay
a royalty to the inventor for its use will
do justice to the inventor and meet,
at the same time, the interests of the
great public and the necessary demands
of industrial progress.</p>

<p>Certain superficial economists, misled
by recent manifestations in trust
building, have hastily concluded that
the problem it presents is a new one.
For example, Collier, in his work on
the subject, says: “The problem of the
trusts is a momentous one, yet it is
unqualifiedly a new one.” Of course it
is not new. It is the same old problem
of monopoly, and the so-called
trust problem is but a phase of it. It
is the problem of monopoly crystallized.
The evils of the trust rivet the
public attention, not because they are
more real than the evils of monopoly
<i>per se</i>, but because they are more obvious.
In some respects the trust, by
combining certain elements of monopoly,
tends to make monopoly more
perfect and its operations more harmful.
But it simply avails itself of monopolistic
institutions—that is to say,
it is built upon land, railroad or tax
monopoly; it takes to itself certain
privileges which society has created and
which have hitherto been appropriated
and exercised by individuals. It therefore
immediately makes these evils
concrete. The trust is thus a manifestation,
and the people, with their customary
thoughtlessness, attack the
manifestation rather than the thing itself—the
fruit of monopoly rather than
the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[Pg 478]</span></p>

<p>The great combinations which suggest
themselves when we think of the
trust problem—is there one of them
which does not owe its existence to
some monopoly privilege? What would
the Standard Oil Company be but for
its control of rights of way, sources of
supply, railroad terminals and the preferential
benefits it is enabled to secure?
What is the Steel Trust but a network
of artificial privilege? Has not Mr.
Charles E. Russell clearly shown, in his
recent articles in <i>Everybody’s Magazine</i>,
that the Beef Trust draws its life-blood
from its monopolization of railroad
privileges? What would the
Sugar Trust be without the favors it
receives from the tariff in its control
of the raw material? Could the Tobacco
Trust exist save for the power of
taxation which strangles competition?</p>

<p>Those mentioned include nearly all
the greater trusts. A more detailed
demonstration of the truth we are insisting
upon could be given, but the
reader can himself carry this line of
analysis further. He will find that it
explains the existence of every oppressive
combination, and that it leaves
little unresolved or unexplained. It
may happen that injurious combinations
will present themselves in which
this element of monopoly does not
clearly appear. But these are by-monopolies,
so to speak, and their sources
of power may be traced to indirect
association with the giant monopolies.</p>

<p>Let us admit all the good there is in
aggregated capital. Let us take the
trust advocates at their word that industry
should be left free of all meddling,
repressive or restrictive legislation.
Is there, then, a common ground
upon which we can meet? To think
so is to delude ourselves. For their
objection is not so much to mischievous
laws of this sort as to interferences
with things as they are. Their plea
for <i>laissez faire</i> is hollow and insincere;
true <i>laissez faire</i> would render every
combination of capital innocuous for
evil; there would be no mammoth aggregations
of wealth in the hands of
single individuals and no plethoric incomes.</p>

<p>The law of competition, let the Socialists
prate as they will, gives only to
those who earn. But from the denial
of this law (of competition) flows
all existing inequality in the distribution
of wealth. There are, it is true,
great swollen fortunes, which seem unconnected
with these artificial laws of
monopoly. Some of these, while clearly
not the result of greater enterprise
or greater ability, seem to be due to
cunningly arranged devices independent
of existing monopoly laws. But
this is so in appearance only. There
are no such made-to-order arrangements
of industrial combination that
can be used for extortion. Competition
is too keenly scrutinizing for such
arrangements to go undetected. The
inevitable day when imitation shall
overtake them can only be permanently
postponed by seeking the shelter
of monopoly.</p>

<p>Some of these gigantic fortunes are
the result of stock speculation. But
these are incidental, and are the profits
and losses of the gambling fraternity—a
game really played with the counters
of monopoly, like “chips” in a poker
game, and the transference of which
from one to another enriches or depletes
the finances only of those who
play. They do not concern the man
who refrains from taking part in the
game, and whether it be played with
railroad stocks or industrials is no
great matter. If these gamblers sometimes
use the moneys on deposit in
public institutions—as Mr. Lawson
has asserted they do—that also is another
question, though a momentous
one.</p>

<p>With the dissolving of these giant
combinations which would result from
the removal of the laws of monopoly
would disappear the great host of gamblers
and stock jugglers. The great
fortunes that result from the granting
of legislative favors would also disappear,
since there would be no longer
any legislative favors to grant. And
so with many other unjust possessions.
And with them would be banished forever
much that corrupts our social and
political life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1">[1]</a> In his definition of a trust Mr. John
Moody, author of the “Truth About
Trusts,” says: “When men form corporate
organizations, or make agreements, they
do not form monopolies. They may take
advantage of monopoly in one way or
another, but they do not create it. The
monopoly itself is a social product, which
exists with the consent of society, and men
in business take advantage of it where
found, just as they take advantage of
other factors for the purpose of achieving
their ends.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2">[2]</a> Charles M. Schwab, in his testimony
before the Industrial Commission at Washington
in excuse of the apparently excessive
capitalization of the Steel Trust,
estimated as the approximate valuation of
plants, mills, machinery and transportation
properties the sum of $380,000,000, but
the value of the ore, coal, natural gas and
limestone properties he put at the enormous
sum of $1,100,000,000.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3">[3]</a> This is vaguely recognized by the
trust advocates and those who have written
on the subject. Professor Jenks, who is one
of the most temperate and discriminating,
says: “So far as the industrial combinations
are the result of special advantages
granted to individuals or corporations,
whether by the state or by others, it is
probable that in most instances the evil
effects would be lessened, if not completely
removed, by the removal of such discriminating
powers.” Which is barely more than
an involved method of stating that the
removal of a cause will also result in removing
the effect.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4">[4]</a> Undoubtedly the control of patents is
an effective source of monopoly in very
many instances. Some of the large combinations
have succeeded in obtaining control
practically of all the patents used in
certain lines of manufacture. That this is
a potent source of power one instance alone
may suffice to prove. Professor Jenks tells
us that all of the barbed wire made in this
country at the present time, as well as
the wire fencing, is in the hands of the
American Steel and Wire Company because
that company has all the valuable patents,
with one or two exceptions, in those lines of
manufacturing.</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS</h3>

<p class="blockquot space-below2">Maxwell Fair, an Englishman who has amassed a
colossal fortune on ’Change, inherits from his ancestors
a remarkable tendency to devote his life to some
object, generally a worthy, if peculiar one, which is
extravagantly chivalrous. The story opens with Fair
and Mrs. Fair standing over the body of a man who
has just been shot in their house—a foreigner, who
had claimed to be an old friend of Mrs. Fair. Fair
sends her to her room, saying: “Leave everything to
me.” He hides the body in a chest, and decides to
close the house “for a trip on the Continent.” Fair
tells the governess, Kate Mettleby, that he loves her;
that there is no dishonor in his love, in spite of Mrs.
Fair’s existence, and that, until an hour ago, he
thought he could marry her—could “break the self-imposed
conditions of his weird life-purpose.” They
are interrupted before Kate, who really loves him, is
made to understand. While the Fairs are entertaining
a few old friends at dinner, Kate, not knowing that
it contains Mrs. Fair’s blood-stained dress, is about to
hide a parcel in the chest when she is startled by the
entrance of Samuel Ferret, a detective from Scotland
Yard. He tells her that he, with other detectives, is
shadowing the foreign gentleman who came to the
Fair house that day and has not yet left it. He persuades
Kate to promise that she will follow the suspect
when he leaves the house and then report at Scotland
Yard. As soon as Ferret is gone she lifts the lid off
the chest, drops the package into it, and, with a
shriek, falls fainting to the floor. Mr. and Mrs. Fair
run to her aid. On being revived Kate goes to Scotland
Yard, where, in her anxiety to shield Maxwell
Fair from suspicion, she inadvertently leads the detectives
to think that a crime has been committed at
the Fair house. The two detectives are piecing
together the real facts from the clues she has given,
when Ferret is summoned to the telephone by his
associate, Wilson, whom he had left on guard in the
home of the Fairs. Fair tells Sir Nelson Poynter, at
the latter’s country place, that he has committed some
crime, and explains that Mrs. Fair is not his wife—that
a Cuban scoundrel had married her, already having a
wife, and deserted her, and that he, Fair, had brought
her and her children to England, giving her his name
before the world, yet being her husband in name only.
Sir Nelson and Fair’s other friends, Allyne and Travers,
begin to suspect his sanity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“BUT what is the ridiculous idea
that has turned your head?
What sort of idiotic crime
would you ask us to believe that you
have committed? Come, sir, out with
it—what’s the charge against this villainous
man?” asked Sir Nelson, with
equal certainty and confidence.</p>

<p>“Only a trifle,” answered Fair. “Just
a quiet little—murder!”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” shouted the good
old fellow, thumping his knee with his
clenched fist. “That settles it, sir.
Sir Porter will have you in a straitjacket
before night. Murder, eh? You
burglar, forger, pirate—you!”</p>

<p>Fair waited until Sir Nelson had had
his laugh, and then said with irritating
persistency: “Quite another sort of
jacket, I think, sir.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see, we’ll see,” retorted Sir
Nelson, and then, abruptly changing
the subject and his own expression,
“but, I say, Fair, why have you never
married Janet? She was, of course,
free?”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at the question,”
Fair replied, relieved at the change.
“That of course was the first question
which presented itself to my mind. But
by the time that Janet came back into
my life the old love had passed away—or
perhaps I should put it another
way—the love I now found myself
bearing for her was of a different sort.
I am a Fair, you know, Sir Nelson, and
destiny demanded that the passion of
my life be not like those of ordinary
men. So Janet seemed to come to me
not as a woman whom I might think
of as a wife, but as a holy, consecrated,
crucifying Idea which fate had destined
should be the ‘Fair Folly’ of
this generation. I think you know
that each generation in our family has
had its ‘folly.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Sir Nelson, shaking
his head and letting his mind run back
to the follies of the two generations of
Fairs that he had known. “But your
folly, my poor boy, has been so above
the world’s standards of rational conduct
that it is madness in our earthly
eyes—or, perhaps, it is like the ‘foolishness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[Pg 480]</span>
of the saints,’ of which Saint
Paul talks. But now, old hero—or
madman—for reason’s sake, tell me of
this accursed hallucination of yours—this
blooming murder, you know.
Have you killed the Pope or the Czar
of Russia or Napoleon Bonaparte?”</p>

<p>“I appreciate your inability to
accept the truth,” replied Fair. “But
you must do so when I have told you
all. You see, I have murdered so
seldom that I was forgetting to tell you
the details. Well, Sir Nelson, the rascal
whom I——”</p>

<p>He was cut short by the sudden and
alarming appearance of Kate Mettleby,
who came running upon the terrace in
traveling dress and quite out of breath.
Both of the men rose and Sir Nelson
watched Fair’s face with ill-disguised
concern, which rapidly increased as
Fair’s usual self-control gave place to
evident uncontrollable nervousness and
feverish excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh—Mr.—Fair,” gasped Kate, trying
to get her breath; “thank God, you
are here! I was—afraid—that”——</p>

<p>“Miss Mettleby,” interrupted Fair,
advancing to meet her, “I supposed
that you were halfway to Paris by this
time. What has happened? You look
ill.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir,” answered Kate,
“but—I’m out of breath—I ran.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind letting me see this
young lady alone, Sir Nelson?” asked
Fair, noticing that Sir Nelson stood,
dazed and troubled, watching them.</p>

<p>“No, no—by all means,” quickly
responded the old man eagerly. “I
just wanted to see if she would not go
in and refresh herself first. Allow me
to advise Lady Poynter. The poor
girl seems regularly done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, no, sir,” put in
Kate, waving a protest; “I can stop
only a moment. I must return to
town on the next train, sir.”</p>

<p>“But you really can’t, you know,”
said Sir Nelson. “You really must
not think of returning without luncheon—it’s
about ready, you know. I
shall advise Lady Poynter that you
are come,” and he hurried off.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Fair when Kate
looked up at him. “Tell me, Kate—and
tell me quickly and without hesitation,
for nothing can shock me now.
So the worst of it—all of it—at once!”</p>

<p>“Where is Mrs. Fair?” Kate asked,
with a look which begged piteously
that the reply to her question be what
she hoped. “She is here? Say that
she is here!”</p>

<p>“Here?” cried out Fair, now thoroughly
alarmed, a certain suspicion
that had been gathering force shaping
itself into something like certainty in
his mind. “Here. Did she not start
for Paris with you and the children?
What can you mean?”</p>

<p>Kate struggled with the dreadful
fears that were choking her.</p>

<p>“We all left the house together in
the carriage and drove to the railway
station, but there Mrs. Fair said that
she wished to drive to a chemist’s shop,
and we were to wait for her speedy return.
She went off accordingly, and
about twenty minutes later the carriage
came back and John fetched this
letter from Mrs. Fair to me. Take it
and read it—it says that she desired me
to take the children to Mrs. Barrington’s,
and announced that she would
communicate her change of plans to
you. Oh, Mr. Fair, what does it all
mean? I can bear little more of this
suspense!”</p>

<p>“Poor old Janet!” groaned Fair,
taking but not reading the letter which
Kate handed to him. He walked up
and down for a few seconds, then coming
back to Kate said: “I see. I see
it now. My God, what a woman!
Wait here, dear, until I consult Sir Nelson,
for we’ve got to act with life for
the spur. This is a race, Kate—the
maddest ever run!”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Fair—Maxwell,” complained
Kate, “tell me what it all
means! I know about—that horror,
you know, in the chest. I saw it. But
no harm shall come to you, Maxwell,
for I told them at Scotland Yard that
it was not you—and they told me that
they believed me.”</p>

<p>Fair jumped forward and could not
believe what he heard, but the triumph
on her poor little agonized face showed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[Pg 481]</span>
only too clearly that what she said was
true.</p>

<p>“Scotland Yard?” he finally cried
out. “Are you mad?” Then with a
wild hysterical laugh that chilled her,
he added: “So you kindly assured
them that I was innocent, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, failing to note
the irony in his laugh, and conscious
only of the loftiness of her motive.
“Yes, for it would have broken my
heart had they even whispered your
name. Tell me! tell me! What is it?
Whose body is that in the accursed
chest? My mind is going—I can bear
no more! Maxwell, I love you—I love
you!”</p>

<p>“My poor little girl,” he said pityingly,
looking down at her; “my
Kate! We will talk it all over on our
way to town—for I shall go back with
you. Only you must be brave now.
Remember that what I did with my
hand I did not do with my heart, will
you? My hand killed him; not my
mind nor my will. Believe that, will
you not, darling?”</p>

<p>“I will believe neither,” she cried
bitterly. “You did not! you did not!”</p>

<p>“Hush!—they will hear you,”
warned Fair, adding more gently:
“Now wait here and say nothing to
anyone. I will return at once—and
we will catch the next train for town.
Poor, poor Janet—good God, what
work!”</p>

<p>He dashed into the house, and Kate
sat as if dreaming on the garden seat.
After trying to collect her thoughts
and to fathom the deepening mystery
which was overwhelming her, she suddenly
caught sight of the torn letter
which Mrs. March had dropped upon
the seat. Acting mechanically and
scarcely knowing what she was doing
or that she was doing anything at all,
she glanced at the piece of the letter
which she had chanced to pick up—and
at once her mind was awake. There
was a name—a name and an address
that startled her by their seeming incomprehensible
coincidence with her
thoughts at the moment. Hearing
voices approaching before she had fully
taken in the meaning of this new bit of
perplexing tangle, she thrust the scrap
of paper into her pocket. The next
instant she saw Fair coming out of the
door, carrying his portmanteau. At
his side was Mrs. March.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry,” Mrs. March was
saying as they came up to her. “You
have your bag—which means that you
are not waiting for luncheon. Must
you really rush off in this way? I
wanted to speak to you ever so much.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Fair replied, putting down
the bag and consulting a time-table;
“awfully sorry, but I have just heard
that Mrs. Fair was unable to proceed
to Paris this morning, and, of course, I
shall be very anxious until I see her and
learn the cause. I think you have met
Miss Mettleby, Mrs. March?”</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do?” smiled Mrs.
March, giving Kate a warm hand
grasp.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. March,” responded
Kate, and then to Fair: “I
think, if you don’t mind, sir, I’ll go
along through the park by myself. We
have some time, I think, before the
train is due. Good morning.”</p>

<p>“Do,” urged Fair, and when Kate
had disappeared he turned to Mrs.
March not very cheerfully: “You wished
to confess something or other to me?
Do, if you love me, make it something
uproariously funny—or else choose another
father confessor. I’m a bit edgy
this morning, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure you will think it the
merriest news,” replied Mrs. March,
with beaming good nature. “Maxwell—I’m
married!”</p>

<p>Fair looked at her, stupefied. One
expression followed another on his face,
and then, when he had secured his
usual genial expression, he said: “Not
really? Well, all I can say is—one man
is happy. But explain.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it just like me to slip over
to Brussels and be married quietly?
You know I hate the regulation fuss.
And heaven has given me the love of a
man whom I am sure you will love and
respect when you know him. All
heart and soul and honor—a knight and
a poet.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, my dear friend,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[Pg 482]</span>
answered Fair, “I wish you all the happiness
that your good heart deserves.
When may we congratulate you in a
public manner? And what are we to
call you henceforth?”</p>

<p>“It will seem strange to call me by
my new name, won’t it—and a foreign
name, too? My husband’s name is Don
Pablo Mendes, formerly of Santiago de
Cuba,” said Mrs. March, with a flush of
happiness which blanched out and became
the pallor of horror as she saw
the effect on Fair.</p>

<p>He dropped the portmanteau, which
he had picked up, stared as if stunned
for a moment, and then with a tremendous
effort to spare the wretched
woman as long as possible, he said
huskily: “I beg your pardon—the fact
is, I am far from well—Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” returned Mrs. March,
satisfied that his singular conduct was
really the result of a bad turn. “But
tell me before you go, Maxwell—do
you know my dear Spanish boy?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I do,” he stammered;
“but really I shall miss my
train—good-bye,” and before she could
ask him anything more he was striding
across the park.</p>

<p>“What strange behavior!” she said
to herself as she watched him. “Maxwell
of all men, too! The mirror of
good form—and the one man who
never fails to say the right thing at the
right time. Ah, here he comes back
to make the proper amends. Back so
soon?” she asked as Fair rejoined her
with his hat in his hand. “Forget
something—or did you, like a good
fellow, come back to say just one kind
word?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. March,” he began, speaking
with strange dignity and pain. “I
have come back to implore your pardon.
I lied to you. We shall never
see each other again, and it was dastardly
in me to try to shield myself
from the horrible duty which as one of
your oldest friends I owe you—the
last thing, also, that I can ever do for
you. You are a true woman and a
great soul. Be great enough to face
what I have now to tell you. I do
know Pablo Mendes—and if you have
not told any of your friends about
your unspeakably deplorable marriage,
for God’s sake do not tell them. You
will understand why I say this, and
bless me for saying it soon—you will
thank me until your dying day. Your
secret is, of course, sacred with me.
Mrs. March, brace yourself now—life
is a battle for us all—and victory is not
for them that fight, but for them that
bear—so hear me. You will never see
your husband again. Give me your
hand—so—are you ill? Courage now
for a moment. Mendes is dead. I—Somebody,
in there! Quick! Mrs.
March has fainted!”</p>

<p>Not waiting to help carry her in, he
bade Baggs tell Mr. Allyne and Mr.
Travers to join him in town at once,
and seeing that servants were already
gone to fetch Lady Poynter, he sped
along the avenue to overtake Miss Mettleby,
whose skirts he saw through the
shrubbery at some distance from the
terrace. In ten minutes they were
aboard the train.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p>At about eight o’clock that evening
Fair, who had dined with Allyne and
Travers at the club, reached his own
door and, letting himself in, waited for
their arrival in the small smoking-room
on the first floor of the deserted
and gloomy mansion. As he opened
the street door he thought that he
heard hasty footsteps on one of the
upper stories, but soon he was able to
rid himself of the unpleasant fancy, and
sat quietly reading until his friends
should come.</p>

<p>This they did in a very few minutes—considerably
to his relief—and the
three groped their way up the dark
stairs and along the passage to the
library, which room Fair told them was
to be the scene of their conference.
As they peered in at the door the black
woodwork of the library made the
gloom seem greater than in the passage,
and as they hesitated Fair said:
“Strike a match, will you, Travers?”</p>

<p>“Right you are—if I don’t break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[Pg 483]</span>
my neck first,” answered Travers,
finally managing to get the match
lighted and holding it high over his
head.</p>

<p>“There we are,” said Fair. “Now
I can find the electric light key.”</p>

<p>He found it and turned on the current,
flooding the room with light.
The sudden translation from total
darkness to brilliant light, and the general
feeling of mystery and stealth
with which the house seemed to be
filled, gave all of the men an uncomfortable
sense of being engaged upon
uncanny business.</p>

<p>“I feel like a cross between a burglar
and a blooming ass,” said Allyne,
to break the unbearable silence. “By
Jove, Fair, my wealth is at your disposal,
but I’ll be hanged if you can
borrow much more of my nervous
energy! What’s the beastly game,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I do think,” added Travers, more
seriously, “that we’ve followed you in
the dark about as long as a decent
regard for our feelings—as well as for
your own interests—will permit. Seriously,
old chap, I do not think we
should allow you to go on in this way.
Elucidate, like a good fellow.”</p>

<p>“On my honor, Dick,” replied Fair,
speaking with great earnestness, “this
is no fool’s errand that I have asked
you and Allyne to undertake. It is
the last favor that I shall ever ask you
to do me. Sit down. I’ll go downstairs
and see if I can’t scare up something
to drink.”</p>

<p>“That’s the first rational thing you’ve
said since yesterday,” said Allyne.
“Go, by all means, old man, and make
it brandy and soda.”</p>

<p>“Back in a moment,” answered Fair,
disappearing.</p>

<p>“Honestly, Travers, what do you
make of it?” asked Allyne when they
were alone. “If it’s a joke he has
carried it rather far. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, I don’t know,” replied
Travers wearily and with very genuine
anxiety. “If it were any other
man—but Fair is the coolest and
sanest devil I ever knew. I don’t like
this turn of affairs on my word.
Money and women are the only two
things that could bowl a chap over on
his beam ends in this way, and Fair
can show a clean slate under both of
those heads—so I give it up. But I,
for one, go no further.”</p>

<p>“Unless I am mistaken, his father or
grandfather was mad,” whispered Allyne,
pursing up his lips uncomfortingly;
“but I never thought Maxwell
dippy—that is, you know, not unusually
so. He is devilish queer.”</p>

<p>“In England,” answered Travers,
with a sneer, “everyone is thought
mad who manifests any trace of originality.
In the city they think Fair a
bit off his head because he does everything
that sacred British methods
decry—and grows rich at it. And in
society they think him singular because
he has such a childish way of
telling the truth. You and I know
that he makes friends in society just as
he makes money in the city. No, I
don’t think Fair is mad—I wish to
heaven I could think so.”</p>

<p>Allyne was striding up and down the
room by this time, and when he next
reached Travers he stopped and said:
“Confound it, Travers, he can’t have
done anything so rum as all this melodramatic
rot would make one think.
Give him credit for too good taste for
that, at least.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never fear,” replied Travers,
rising; “I’ve made up my mind. I’ll
give him half an hour more. If he
does not chuck this mystery and give
us the key in plain English, I’ll report
the case to his solicitor and medical
man.”</p>

<p>“Here, too,” grunted Allyne, with a
nervous shrug of his shoulders. “What
a creepy, deuced idiotic thing to bring
us up here tonight! The house feels
like a tomb! By George, I wouldn’t
stop here alone for the world. Did
you see that man across the way when
we came in? He watched us as if we
were a gang of coiners. Lord! If
they were to— What was that?”</p>

<p>Travers, also, had heard the noise,
whatever it was, and both men turned
nervously toward the door and listened.
It was repeated, but faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[Pg 484]</span></p>

<p>“It sounded like footsteps on the
floor above,” said Travers.</p>

<p>“But Fair said there is nobody in the
house,” answered Allyne, adding, with a
return of his usual spirits: “I say, Travers,
just run upstairs and have a look
round, will you, that’s a good fellow?”</p>

<p>“You go,” replied Travers, smiling,
but more in earnest than he would have
cared to admit. “You are younger
than I, and—but here’s Fair.”</p>

<p>Fair came in, carrying a tray on
which were a number of decanters and
glasses, which he placed on the table
before he saw with surprise that the
others were evidently acting under a
strain of some sort.</p>

<p>“I say, old man, were you upstairs a
moment ago?” asked Travers, with a
disquietingly anxious look.</p>

<p>“Upstairs?” asked Fair, with growing
uneasiness. “Why, no. I was below—ever
since I left you. Why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Travers, trying
to throw a careless tone into his
words. “Allyne thought he heard—There
it is again!”</p>

<p>All three had heard it this time—and
all belied with their eyes the smile
which they forced to their lips.</p>

<p>“Wind in the chimney,” muttered
Fair, disavowing all belief in his own
words by going, not to the fireplace, but
to the door to listen. “There is nobody
in the house, anyway,” he added,
still listening at the door.</p>

<p>“It sounded like bare feet—Ugh—give
us a drop of brandy,” growled
Allyne, pretending to more alarm than
he really felt.</p>

<p>Fair returned to the table after closing
the door into the passage, and pouring
a stiff drink for each of them, said,
with a laugh: “Here you go. That
will hearten you up a bit, Allyne.
Why, you look as though you expected
to see a ghost. Never fear, old chap.
Something much more substantial than
spirits is at the bottom of this cheerful
occasion.”</p>

<p>“There was a beastly sly fellow over
the way when we came in,” said
Allyne as he sat on the end of the table
to drink. “Why the deuce did he
watch us like that?”</p>

<p>“He probably wants me,” answered
Fair seriously, “although he does not
yet know that it is I he wants. We
can ask him to escort me to jail as we
go out of the house presently.”</p>

<p>Travers put down his glass with a
bang, spilling the liquor, jumped up
and swung around at Fair, thoroughly
disgusted and exasperated.</p>

<p>“Really, Fair,” he began, “I’ve had
about enough of this. Aren’t you
pressing your little joke a bit too far?
I was just saying to Allyne that I
would give you half an hour. At the
end of that time I——”</p>

<p>Again there was the sound of footsteps
above their heads, and Travers
stopped and all three looked toward
the door as the steps seemed to come
down the stairs. Fair was the first to
regain composure.</p>

<p>“You give me half an hour,” he said
to Travers, “but I shall require only
ten minutes. Have a cigar, and—damn
it, Allyne, let up, you know.
Lock the door if you like, but for
heaven’s sake quit your funk.”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully,” retorted Allyne,
locking the door so quickly that Fair
and Travers laughed genuinely this
time. “There! Now we are cozy,
aren’t we just? A corpse and an undertaker
and a hangman are all we
want to complete our merry little
party.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Allyne!” shouted Travers,
watching Fair’s face. “Now, Fair, for
the love of sanity—what’s the answer?”</p>

<p>Fair poured out another drink for
himself, and pushing the bottles toward
Travers, threw himself full length upon
a lounge. Puffing slowly at his fresh
cigar, he began speaking with perfect
composure:</p>

<p>“You fellows remember a Cuban by
the name of Mendes—the man of whom
I have often spoken to you, do you not?
You know—Don Pablo Mendes—a
great chess player?”</p>

<p>“Certainly—you spoke of him only
yesterday. Friend of Lopez? Yes—well,
what of him?” asked Travers, and
Fair turned his head toward Allyne,
who seemed to be listening for noises
and not to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[Pg 485]</span></p>

<p>“I saw you speak to him one night
at the opera,” said Allyne, without taking
his eyes from the door. “Looked
like a twin brother of the devil—diamonds,
yellow fingers, hair oil, et cetera.
Proceed, to wit, go on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the man,” answered
Fair, and then leaning over to flick the
ashes from his cigar into the hearth, he
added, without the slightest excitement
or emotion: “Well—I murdered
him yesterday, you know.”</p>

<p>“You are drunk,” sweetly remarked
Travers, with a look of infinite relief,
as of course Fair now was admitting
that he had been twigging them.</p>

<p>“Murdered him, eh?” grunted Allyne,
executing a series of maneuvres
that landed him on Fair’s chest.
“Murdered a yellow cigarette twister,
did you? What of that? Why, I
strangled my grandmother last night.”</p>

<p>“By all that is holy,” Fair cried out
hoarsely, “gentlemen, you sha’n’t go
on in this way. If you will only allow
me to tell my story, you will realize that
I am a ruined man with death hanging
over me, and, as my friends, I ask you
to stand by me, to see that I face my
fate and end my life in a way to prove
that I was not altogether unworthy of
two such friends. Will you do this?”</p>

<p>He turned his white, drawn face from
one to the other beseechingly.</p>

<p>“Fair,” cried Travers, clutching his
hand and speaking fast and like one
who has passed beyond consternation
into the very heart of abandonment,
“if you are not mad, what does this
mean? If you are in earnest—if this
horrible thing is true—you know that
Allyne and I would risk our lives to
save yours, but why——?”</p>

<p>“Twenty times,” broke in Allyne,
pushing Fair back into a seat. “We
would risk twenty lives for you, old
man; but if you have really rid the
world of that unhung dog, why in the
name of Mrs. Fair and the children, to
say nothing of us and common sense,
don’t you get away until we can get
your defense in order? Forgive my
fool tongue, old man, for, of course, I
could not believe that this was anything
but some new sort of game. Did
the blackguard attack you? Don’t
let the ugly business get on your nerves
too much to let you see that this is no
murder at all.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in Travers eagerly, groping
through the dark to catch at any
straw of hope or light. “And for God’s
sake leave the country until your solicitor
can prepare your case. Come,
now, explain.”</p>

<p>“It’s a simple story,” began Fair
more calmly now that he had got them
to accept the situation. “The fool
came here to extort blackmail—and I
killed him. Mrs. Fair saw me, and,
Travers, you saw my pistol, you remember—still
warm and with one chamber
discharged. The servants heard the
shot. The man’s body is still in the
house, and nothing remains but to give
myself up to the police. Lopez knows
the history of my relations with his
friend, and he will be only too glad to
testify that I had threatened to kill
Mendes, against whom I had a long-standing
grudge. The case against me
is complete, you see, so I prefer to end
it all by surrendering myself at once.”</p>

<p>“Not if we can stop you,” shouted
Travers fiercely. “And as for the
pistol—unless you go regularly off
your head and tell them that I saw
it, they will never know it. And, of
course, you know, your wife’s testimony
would not be taken against you,
even if she should wish to give it.”</p>

<p>“But she is not my wife,” groaned
Fair, looking up at him.</p>

<p>“What!” thundered Travers, significantly
glancing at Allyne, who wheeled
around to Fair and exclaimed:
“Cæsar’s ghost! Look here, Fair, you
are rubbing it in rather too deep, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will be a pretty story when
it is told in the papers,” muttered Fair,
his hands thrust deep in his pockets
and his legs stretched out in front of
him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will,” replied Travers,
rising and going toward the door with
his hat on, “but I don’t propose to
hear you tell it. My God, man, you
can’t expect us to hear it and then
stand up and swear away your life!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[Pg 486]</span>
You’re mad. My duty is clear. Good
night. Allyne, ring me up at the club
in an hour. This is—” He did not
finish the sentence, but hurried to the
door, which he had reached when Fair
spoke.</p>

<p>“All right, old man,” he said, without
turning to Travers, “if you choose to
desert. I have faced tight places before.
I’m game now.”</p>

<p>“No, hang it, Fair,” answered Travers,
coming back from the door and
confronting Fair, “you know that I
will not leave you; but why must you
ask Allyne and me to learn all this—when
we could otherwise swear to the
fact of your being what we have always
known you to be—yes, know you to be
now—for, by gad, you can’t get me to
believe you.”</p>

<p>“Hang the swearing,” said Allyne,
trying to laugh. “If they get me on
the witness stand, I’ll let them know
what I think of greasy foreigners, and
my views as to sending them where
they belong. Go on, Fair, and tell us
what they did next.”</p>

<p>“Then sit down, Travers, and hear
me out,” replied Fair, filling the three
glasses and regaining an air of quiet.</p>

<p>“Blaze away,” answered Travers,
dropping into a chair with resignation.
“At the bottom of a hole one can’t fall
lower—so go on.”</p>

<p>“Have a drink, both of you, and
we’ll get on,” said Fair, and all three
sipped their drink in silence for some
minutes. Then Fair said:</p>

<p>“Many years ago the noble woman
whom you know as Mrs. Fair was married
to the wretched man whom I
killed yesterday. She afterward discovered
that he had a living wife, and
she, of course, therefore, found herself
a nameless outcast. She appealed to
me, and for two reasons I offered her
the protection of my name. I had
loved her some years before, and I inherited
from my fathers a sort of morbid
craving to sacrifice my life to a
cause or purpose which the reason and
the prudence of all normally minded
men would discountenance.”</p>

<p>“Surely wedding such a glorious
woman as Mrs. Fair was scarcely what
one could look at as a sacrifice of
one’s life,” protested Travers when
Fair paused for a moment.</p>

<p>“She is indeed a queen, a priceless
woman,” murmured Fair quietly, “but
her children are not my children—she
never became my wife. She has been
a sacred vocation to me, and while
men envied me the love of such a wife,
I was really living the life of a celibate
because of a mad, but inexorable, fixed
idea. You fail to understand this?
So do I. I only know that nothing in
heaven or earth could have deterred
me from assuming the position in
which I have lived so long. This may
be madness—but it is of the very essence
of my being. And then I came
to love another woman—and you may
imagine what I suffered. But there
was a satisfaction in it all which, of
course, you men will be unable to comprehend.
But, see the irony of fate.
The only thing that made life possible
has been dashed away from me. I
lived supported by the thought that
Janet and her children were saved from
shame by my effacement, and now I
must proclaim that they are not my
flesh and blood, to shield them from
the disgrace of being thought a murderer’s
kin. Isn’t it horrible? But
it is only fate’s swift way of damning
me for what I had just been so weak
as to decide to do. I was about to
let my love—the gnawing hunger of a
real life—have way. I had decided,
on this very day, to proclaim my love
for— Fellows, for God’s sake, never
go back upon your destiny even if, as
in my case, it should mean lifelong
torture. After all, there may not be a
hell after death, for there’s one on this
side of the grave—and I am in it.”</p>

<p>He dropped his head on the edge of
the table. Allyne, whose heart was
like a child’s, could bear the sight of
his agony no longer, and walked to the
end of the room. Travers came over
to Fair’s side and laid his hand on his
head.</p>

<p>“This is the most stupendous thing
I ever heard of, Fair,” he said; “and
if there is such a thing as justice, you
shall not suffer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[Pg 487]</span></p>

<p>“There is a thing called justice,”
replied Fair, looking up, “and therefore
I must die.”</p>

<p>“Not if you will allow us to save you
from yourself,” cried Allyne, returning
to them. “My soul, man, no case can
be made out against you unless you
make it yourself. Do let us act for
you. Counsel must be secured at once.
Come, come, I know the very man.”</p>

<p>“Presently, presently,” answered
Fair. “I telegraphed Marshall, my
solicitor, that we would call at his
chambers tonight at ten. But before
we go I want you two to have the case
in detail. I promise to be governed
by you and Marshall when you have
all the facts. That’s reasonable.”</p>

<p>“Then there will be no difficulty, I
promise you,” replied Allyne, with renewed
good spirits. “Marshall has no
romantic rubbish in his gray matter.
Maxwell, you’re a disembodied ghost
of some crusader who hasn’t heard that
Adam and Eve left Paradise some time
ago for good. I drink to you, Sir
Altruist.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old chap,” said Fair, with
moistening eyes.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I feel better,” exclaimed
Travers, stretching his arms and holding
Fair by both shoulders. “I’d like
to be worthy of you, Fair.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, I say, Dick,” protested
Fair. “In a few weeks it will be
deucedly awkward to be asked if you
were not a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” retorted
Travers defiantly. “Now, the details.”</p>

<p>While they sat, Fair walked to and
fro before them with folded arms.</p>

<p>“Well,” he began, “for five years I
was happy in seeing Janet and her two
boys safe under the shadow of my
broken heart; but about a year ago Lopez
came to me and told me that some
disreputable Cuban acquaintances of
his had learned poor Janet’s secret,
and that a paltry hundred pounds
would keep them quiet. I, of course,
sent him about his business and reported
the matter to the police. The
Cubans quietly got hold of Janet—just
how I was never quite sure—and played
upon her love for her children until they
extorted one sum after another from
her without my knowledge. At last
they demanded a sum so vast that the
poor girl was compelled to appeal to
me. I told her to ignore their letters,
and had them shadowed by detectives.
We discovered that Mendes himself
was at the head of a gang whose plan
was to get the secrets of rich families for
blackmailing purposes, his private fortune
having been gambled away on the
Continent. More than once Lopez or
Mendes has ruined a woman of standing,
and while pretending to remain
a devoted lover, has told the other, who
would at once begin the extortion of
hush money. Mendes came here yesterday—and
I shot him like a dog.
Now Lopez will show that I was the
paramour of my victim’s wife, and that
my crime followed naturally upon
Mendes tracking his wife to my house,
and there learning that I had palmed
her off as my wife for years. Those
are the facts. Complete, wouldn’t you
say?”</p>

<p>Allyne, always more susceptible to
all emotions than Travers, frankly
looked the horror he felt as he began
to realize the truly desperate situation
in which Fair now was; but Travers,
after thinking for a few moments in
silence, spoke out bravely: “Confound
it, man, isn’t it a principle of law that
a man is innocent until proven guilty?
Who knows that you killed the scoundrel?
And if suspicion should be
drawn toward you, why, then let them
prove the charge if they can. And,
anyhow, can’t you plead that you
killed him while protecting Mrs. Fair?
The blackguard’s character will make
it difficult for Lopez to prove Mendes’s
alleged relations with Janet. I’d be
hanged if I’d be hanged just for the
fun of it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but my dear fellow,” returned
Fair, arguing out his point in his customary
cool way, “you forget. It is
known that he came to this house.
It is known that he did not leave it.
His body, my dear friend—his corpse,
you know, is a nasty bit of evidence
that we can’t get rid of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[Pg 488]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” answered
Travers, face to face with the calm man,
“do you mean to tell us that the—that
the chap’s corpse, you know, was in
the house last night while you and Janet
were entertaining us? If you are the
man you are, surely no woman at any
rate could have stood that.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t know her,” smiled
Fair. “To save me—yes, to please
me even, that woman would do anything—bear
anything.”</p>

<p>“And she jolly well ought to,” put
in Allyne, slapping Fair’s back, and
then with a nervous look about the
room: “I say, what did you do with
the—with that infernal thing, you
know?”</p>

<p>“With the body?” asked Fair, with
entire freedom from excitement. “It
is here yet.”</p>

<p>“Here?” cried Allyne angrily and
sick with perplexity.</p>

<p>“In the house now?” asked Travers,
scowling but not believing.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Fair quietly.
“What could I have done with it last
night? You all came in within a few
minutes of the deed. Yes, it is in the
house—it is in this room now.”</p>

<p>“The devil you say!” exclaimed
Allyne, facing about as if he feared that
the dreadful thing was back of him
somewhere.</p>

<p>“Rather a gruesome thing to joke
about, isn’t it?” asked Travers sadly,
and still utterly unable to believe what
he heard.</p>

<p>“Horrible—but true,” answered Fair,
with disconcerting calmness as he
walked slowly over toward the chest
by the fireplace, while Allyne and
Travers watched him breathlessly.
“It is here.”</p>

<p>He seemed to take an eternity to do
whatever it was that he intended to do,
but finally as he stood over the chest
he said, looking from one to the other:
“If a man ever had a more terrible
guest under his roof than mine, I pity
him. Look!”</p>

<p>As he said this he suddenly stooped
and raised the lid of the chest. The
two now thoroughly horrified men were
standing on either side of him. They
all peered, shuddering, into the chest.
<i>It was empty.</i></p>

<p>“Gone?” moaned Fair, for the first
time betraying uncontrolled horror.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” shouted Travers,
delirious with joy. “You see, you have
been dreaming this whole cursed nightmare.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Allyne was running about
the room, swinging a chair over his
head and shouting like a madman.
Coming back to Fair he sang out with
hysterical laughter: “Rest and quiet—rest—and
qui—et, sir—that’s what we
need. Ice on the head, hot water at
the feet—and a month at sea. May I
have the pleasure?” Before Fair could
stop him he had waltzed him around
the room. At last Fair broke away
from him, and holding his hands to his
splitting head, he brought them back
to a full realization of the awful truth
by the expression on his face.</p>

<p>“Hush!” he cried to Allyne. “For
God’s sake, Allyne, stop it. I swear
on my honor that I put it into this
chest. It has been discovered by somebody
and removed today. I sat up
all night in this room, so that it must
have been taken away today. Come.
That’s the end. I might as well surrender
without delay.”</p>

<p>“But wait, wait,” broke in Travers.
“Who knew of it’s being here? Who
could have discovered it? Now don’t
be rash. Let us think before we act.
How could it have been found? That
is, if it ever was here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are a thousand ways in
which it might have been found,”
answered Fair, ignoring his unbelief.</p>

<p>“Did Mrs. Fair know about it?”
asked Allyne, and was startled by the
effect of his question.</p>

<p>Fair sprang up, thought for a moment,
and then exclaimed: “By heaven,
Allyne, that’s it. My God! Do
you know what that means?” He
clenched his hands and glared at them,
stupefied with grief.</p>

<p>“It means,” said Travers, “that she
has disposed of it. It means that your
chances are a thousand-fold better than
before.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” shrieked Fair. “It means—but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[Pg 489]</span>
no—she could not be so unspeakably
unkind to the children as
to try to prove that she killed him.
No. I give it up, then. Come, come,
I can’t bear this much longer. I must
get the relief of surrendering myself.
Come.”</p>

<p>“If you attempt to give yourself up,
by gad, I’ll have you locked up for a
dangerous lunatic,” said Travers, with
strange new determination as he noticed
how rapidly Fair was breaking.
“I tell you, Fair, that— Hark! That
was that beastly footstep again. I’m
not a coward, but this— Hark!”</p>

<p>They listened with tense faces.
Again the sound. And again.</p>

<p>“That was certainly a footstep—upstairs,
too,” whispered Travers.
“Come Fair, this is no place for you
now. Allyne, if he refuses to come
with us, help me to force him out of
this hole. Hear me? Now come.”</p>

<p>Fair struggled away from their grasp
and ran to the door, saying: “I will go
with you, but I am going upstairs first—alone.”</p>

<p>“You are going to do nothing of the
sort,” replied Travers, again grasping
his arm and pulling him back.</p>

<p>“Don’t come with me, please,”
pleaded Fair; “I’ll be only a minute.”</p>

<p>“Never fear,” answered Allyne at
his other arm; “I wouldn’t go up there
with anybody—but you are not going
up, either. Out with him, Travers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, come, old man,” begged
Travers earnestly. “Notify the police
that thieves are in the house, call the
fire brigade—anything, but don’t be a
fool and expose yourself to you don’t
know what danger. Come!”</p>

<p>They strained at him, and presently
Fair gave in, saying: “Very well, it is
getting a bit on my nerves, I confess.
Go to the top of the stairs before I turn
out the light. All ready? There.”</p>

<p>He turned out the light and felt his
way to the stairs, down which Travers
and Allyne preceded him, and the
next moment they stepped out into the
blessed coolness and relief of the street.</p>

<p>The instant that Fair turned out the
light in the library a man stole quickly
in from the adjoining study and groped
his way to the chest in the total
darkness. Just after the street door
slammed two persons, who had been
listening on the floor above the library,
began whispering as they descended
the stairs and approached that room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Fair and his two friends
called a cab and drove off eastward and
soon were set down in the Strand near
the law courts, proposing to make the
remainder of their journey on foot.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p>At sixty Marshall, Maxwell Fair’s
solicitor, found himself a bachelor, a
solicitor with an income of twenty
thousand pounds and a very decided attachment
for his few wealthy clients and
an aversion to new ones. Long past
the necessity of accepting new clients,
Marshall, like so many old Templars,
asked for nothing but to be let alone
among his books and cronies in the
Inner Temple, and allowed to spend his
brief holidays at his shooting-box by
the Norfolk Broads.</p>

<p>It was with no very good grace, therefore,
that he returned to town on that
wet Sunday in response to an absurdly
urgent telegram from Fair, whose
usual business was exactly to old Marshall’s
taste, since it consisted of drawing
perfunctory documents having to
do with real estate, and never involving
critical issues of any sort.</p>

<p>But the snug thousands which Fair’s
enormous interests brought to him
annually made it impolitic to ignore his
most uncharacteristic bit of hysterics.
Accordingly, after dining in gloomy
solitude at his quiet little chop-house,
Marshall surprised his laundress by
turning up at his chambers in the Inner
Temple at nine o’clock on Sunday evening
in a crusty temper. Fair would
arrive at ten, so Marshall settled down
for an hour with Browne’s “Religio
Medici,” when to an irritating knock
he sang out a curt, “Come in! come in!”
and a lady entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[Pg 490]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Marshall, I believe?” said the
lady.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” replied Marshall,
rising; “but my business hours—In
fact, I am engaged—just leaving, you
know—and, besides, I expect a gentleman
by appointment at any moment.”</p>

<p>“I venture to think that, whatever
his business may be, you will consider
my case the one requiring immediate
attention,” quietly answered the
lady, seating herself, although the old
solicitor had not suggested her doing
so.</p>

<p>“Case? Case?” exclaimed Marshall.
“Why, bless us all, I haven’t taken any
new cases in years. Couldn’t think of
it, madam.”</p>

<p>“But,” returned the lady vehemently,
“a crime has been committed,
and I——”</p>

<p>“Crime, you say?” shouted Marshall
as if he were being insulted.
“Good heavens, my good woman, do
you imagine that I am interested in
crime?”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Fair has, I think, some
claim upon your advice and counsel?”
replied the lady, with the assurance of
one who trumps an ace.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fair has certainly every claim
upon me,” answered Marshall, sitting
down and becoming the cautious and
alert barrister at once, “and I trust you
will appreciate my unwillingness to
discuss anything concerning my clients
with strangers.”</p>

<p>“Strangers?” cried the woman, with
such eagerness that Marshall began to
fear all sorts of possible female entanglement.
“Why, sir, I am his—I
mean, I know Mr. Fair very well.”</p>

<p>“Really, madam,” protested the
solicitor, now thoroughly certain that
this woman and the urgent telegram
were unpleasantly related. “Really,
you know, I must beg you will call at
some other time. Allow me to see
you to your carriage.”</p>

<p>“It will be necessary for you to
hear me,” replied the lady firmly. “I
see that you do not remember me, but
we have met before. You were at Mr.
Fair’s place in Norfolk about five
years ago. You were presented to
Mrs. Maxwell Fair. Well, I am she.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, dear madam,”
exclaimed Marshall, jumping up, “I
did, indeed, fail to recognize you.
That’s a sign I’m getting old, is it not?
This is an honor, really.”</p>

<p>“Alas, sir, I fear that you will think
it anything but that,” replied Mrs. Fair
nervously. “I desire to state before
going into the matter which brought
me here that I am not the wife of Mr.
Maxwell Fair—Mr. Fair never married.
I see that this fills you with amazement—pray,
don’t misjudge him. Believe
me, Mr. Fair deserves your deepest
regard and admiration. My children
are not his children. He has been a
father, a brother, a chivalrous protector—that
is all.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear madam, this is quite
beyond belief,” stammered the solicitor.</p>

<p>“It is the truth, as you will learn
presently from him. I came here simply
to tell you that, whatever Mr. Fair
may say, my crime does not involve
him, as it would of course do if I were
his wife. Now for my story.”</p>

<p>“I must remind you, Mrs. Fair,” interrupted
Marshall sternly, “that if
your crime, as you choose to call it,
is to the prejudice to Mr. Fair, I must
decline to hear your statement, as, in
the event of any issue arising, I must,
of course, act on his and not on your
behalf.”</p>

<p>“But it is not a question as between
Mr. Fair and me,” answered Mrs. Fair.
“The simple and horrible fact is I
killed a man yesterday—a Cuban
named Pablo Mendes—a wretch who
had blasted my life. He dared to pursue
me even into my protector’s house.
He heaped the foulest insults upon Mr.
Fair and the children and me—so, in a
mad access of frenzy and horror, I shot
and instantly killed him. I desire to
give myself up to the police. What
shall I do, sir?”</p>

<p>Marshall was walking up and down
now with his hands clasped behind his
back, and for several moments he did
not answer. Then he said as he stood
confronting her: “If there were no witnesses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[Pg 491]</span>
and the man can be proved to
have been your traducer and persecutor,
it would not be difficult to set up
a powerful defense. He invaded your
house, demanded money, threatened
you—or, wait, wait—I have it! On
failing to extort the money, he attacked
you, and you, having anticipated
just such an assault, had taken
the precaution to be armed—and shot
him down for the blackguard he was.
Why, my dear Mrs. Fair, a jury would
acquit you without leaving the courtroom.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but the facts are not as you
state them,” cried Mrs. Fair, rising and
grasping the old man’s hand feverishly.
“There was no attack. And, oh,
sir, I did it! I did it! I say I! Take
me to the police—and make them believe
that it was I—or—or—well, I
can’t tell you now, but unless you
make them believe me, something
most horrible will occur. Do this—do
this, Mr. Marshall, for God’s
sake.”</p>

<p>“But we must consider this from
every side,” replied Marshall, getting
Mrs. Fair into a seat again and continuing
his walk. “Give me a little
time to think it out. Could you manage
to return early in the morning?
You are evidently very ill. Rest will
refresh you—and, moreover, nothing
can be done wisely tonight.”</p>

<p>“Very well—but tell me that you believe
me—tell me that,” implored Mrs.
Fair, rising to go. She was indeed
nearly at the end.</p>

<p>“Of course I must accept your statement,”
answered Marshall with much
gentleness. “Yet it by no means follows
that the consequences need be
what you apprehend. Allow me to
show you down to your carriage.”</p>

<p>“Here is my statement,” she said as
she placed a document on the table and
took the arm which the old solicitor
offered her. “Act upon it, sir—it is a
woman’s last story—written in her
blood and that of her children. Act
upon it, sir, act upon it—no matter
what Mr. Fair says.”</p>

<p>“I promise nothing, madam,” replied
Marshall, leading her to the door.
“You are in no condition to take the
best or the wisest view of this most
incredible affair. Depend upon it, I
shall act only for your best interest and
that of Mr. Fair. Come.”</p>

<p>He led her down to the street and,
after seeing her safely to her carriage,
slowly retraced his steps into the quiet
precincts of the Temple. When about
to enter the door at the foot of his worn
stairs, two men came walking quickly
from the thoroughfare without, and one
of them, recognizing him, said: “This
is my friend Allyne—Lord Linklater’s
son, you know, Mr. Marshall. May we
have a few minutes of your time?—very
urgent matter!”</p>

<p>“Travers?” said Marshall as he
caught sight of his face under the gas
lamp. “What on earth brings you to
this old graveyard at this time? I
know your honored father, Lord Linklater,
Mr. Allyne. Come up, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>Once more the solicitor entertained
no very pleasant conjectures as to the
purpose of his visitors, whom he knew
to be close personal friends of Maxwell
Fair’s. The whole departure was
as upsetting as it was sudden.</p>

<p>“Rather a beastly time to intrude
upon you, Mr. Marshall,” said Travers
apologetically as they seated themselves
in Marshall’s library.</p>

<p>“And on the beastliest sort of business,”
put in Allyne.</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall, finding nothing particular
to say, remained silent.</p>

<p>“We were asked to come here this
evening by Mr. Maxwell Fair,” said
Travers, explaining. “He will be here
at ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” softly remarked the imperturbable
lawyer; “then we will wait.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you say,” protested
Allyne in spite of the signal from
Travers. “Why, we came ahead of
him expressly.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Allyne,” broke in Travers.
“Fair knows that we are here, Mr.
Marshall—in fact, we came rather at
his suggestion. He gave us full permission
to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“I shall, of course, be very glad to
hear anything that you may deem it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[Pg 492]</span>
desirable to tell me. Pray proceed,”
said Marshall not very eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, then, sir, it is with the utmost
sorrow that we have to tell you that
we are convinced poor Fair has become
suddenly insane on a certain dreadful
subject,” went on Travers, irritated by
Marshall’s manner.</p>

<p>“Ah, there we shall have to move
very slowly—very—slowly,” said Marshall
when Travers stopped. “Mr.
Fair is thought to be of unsound mind
on a number of subjects by a number
of persons. He is so successful, you
know—so original, that others who are
merely British fail to understand him.
Moreover, Fair is unselfish, sympathetic,
altruistic—and of course appears
mad to our smug, hoggish
world.”</p>

<p>“Damn it,” exclaimed Allyne,
“that’s all, as you say, but the dear
fellow has gone clean off his head this
time, you know. You just wait until
Travers gives you the details.”</p>

<p>“I am waiting,” answered Marshall
calmly.</p>

<p>“Before we come to that,” said
Travers in answer to Marshall’s look,
“I believe, Mr. Marshall, that you knew
Fair’s father, did you not?”</p>

<p>“Intimately—and his grandfather
also. What of them?”</p>

<p>“What sort were they?”</p>

<p>“Very much like Fair—both were
thought mad.”</p>

<p>“In what way? They were men of
tremendous will power and fixity of
purpose, were they not? I have reason
for asking.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. They were idealists,
dreamers, monomaniacs—but why?”</p>

<p>“I thought as much. The stuff
martyrs are made of. Tell us about
them, if you don’t mind, Mr. Marshall,”
said Travers, unaccountably insistent.</p>

<p>“Very well,” began Marshall, really
glad to be able thus to kill time until
Fair arrived. “His grandfather got it
into his head that he was bound in
honor to extricate his publishers—he
was an author, you know—from their
financial difficulties, although it was
clearly proved in court that they had
only their own speculative folly to
thank for their failure. Well, poor
old Fair lost his all and even mortgaged
the Norfolk estates. In spite of his
solicitors, he pressed forward eagerly
to ruin, and died perfectly happy in the
knowledge that he had lived up to his
ideal. Mad—stark mad!”</p>

<p>“By Jove, it sounds like Fair all over
again!” exclaimed Allyne.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on the old lawyer, warming
to his favorite work of decrying
idealism of every sort. “Yes, gentlemen,
and our Mr. Fair’s father was no
better than his grandfather. He spent
the first half of his life in freeing the
estates from their heavy encumbrances—and
the second half in throwing away
all that he had accumulated in the first.
His specialty was young geniuses—any
kind of young genius, musical, literary,
artistic. Any chap who could not get
an editor to print his stuff could count
on Fair bringing out an <i>édition de luxe</i>
at his own expense. And any young
woman had but to get her mother to
tell him with tears in her eyes that she
had wonderful musical promise and
away she would go to Germany to be
educated—of course at Fair’s expense.
You probably know that he died in
lodgings in Mile End, where he had removed
in order to live among those
whom he, poor old dreamer, imagined
would appreciate his sympathy. He
left our Mr. Fair nothing but the estates
heavily mortgaged again.”</p>

<p>“And Maxwell is a chip of the old
block,” commented Travers when the
solicitor stopped. “But Mr. Marshall,
he has done more than either his father
or grandfather in the way of self-effacement.
His life is one long tragedy for
an idea. That is bad enough. But
now he proposes actually to destroy
himself for it. Unless we can prevent
it, he will die.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens,” cried Marshall, unable
to treat the terrible intensity on
Travers’s face with his customary calmness.
“It’s not quite so bad as that.
What, in the name of reason, is the man
about now?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Travers, glad to have
at last roused the stoical man of law
from his leathery, noncommittal expression,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[Pg 493]</span>
“Fair declares that he has
committed a crime which will send
him to the gallows— Why, what ails
you?”</p>

<p>Travers stopped and stared at the
lawyer, who was strangely delighted
by his last few words. Marshall’s acute
mind had evidently been scouting.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Marshall, regaining
his quiet manner; “I was thinking
of a similar case that once came to my
notice. Go on.”</p>

<p>“There is no evidence against him,
and yet the wretched victim of his own
high-flown notions is determined to go
ahead to destruction. For God’s sake,
sir, help us to prevent this, even by
placing him in a madhouse.” Travers
saw that his words touched the old
man, but that professional caution
and habitual reserve were restraining
him from avowing his purpose, whatever
it might be.</p>

<p>This angered Allyne, who broke in
with the sneering comment: “The law
keeps no end of rascals from getting
their richly deserved medicine. I
think it’s a jolly beastly outrage if it
can’t prevent an innocent man from
hanging himself.”</p>

<p>“The ways of the law,” answered
Marshall, with cold judicial accent,
“the ways of the law, Mr. Allyne, are
not as our ways. The law proceeds
without sentiment or bias, and must
go straight to its object in the light of
fact.”</p>

<p>“But, I tell you, the facts can’t be as
Fair states them to be, don’t you
know,” retorted Allyne hotly, galled
by the lawyer’s coolness and formality.</p>

<p>“Then Mr. Fair has nothing to fear,”
quietly replied Marshall. “It is ten
o’clock. Fair is a punctual man—he
will be here immediately. Suppose
that we allow him to explain himself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I will let him go
too far. Why, gentlemen, this is monstrous!
Do you mean to say, Marshall,
that you——?”</p>

<p>A knock interrupted Allyne, and immediately
Fair came in, looking not at
all as though he could possibly be the
subject of his friend’s anxiety.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” Fair began, “to
learn from your laundress, Marshall,
that my telegram brought you back to
town from the country. I promise
you it won’t happen again.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” returned Marshall,
studying Fair closely, “I was only too
glad of an excuse to come back to
town. You know, we old Templars
don’t enjoy the country—been caged
here too long for that. Sit down, dear
fellow. What can I get up for you—sherry?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, nothing for me. Perhaps
the others——”</p>

<p>“Lord, no!” roared Allyne before
Marshall could ask.</p>

<p>“Well, then, to the point,” said Fair,
seating himself calmly and lighting a
cigar with the air of a director of a company
about to discuss the treasurer’s
report. “Travers has told you, Marshall?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered the solicitor.
“We were discussing peculiarities of
temperament. I was just telling your
friends what people used to say of your
father. You know, we are all mad on
some subject.”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied Fair, smiling.
“Allyne has mentioned madness and
madhouses, I should say, about once
every five minutes all day long.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we mean it,” thundered
Allyne. “At it now. This is rum.”</p>

<p>“I can put the facts before you in a
word, Marshall,” said Fair.</p>

<p>“Do so. I am all attention,” returned
the lawyer, settling back into
his chair with a puzzling look, in which
there was certainly a trace of amusement
not easily explained.</p>

<p>“Some Cuban gentlemen have been
extorting blackmail from certain aristocratic
families,” went on Fair in a monotone,
“and they had, without my
knowledge, frightened Mrs. Fair into
paying them considerable sums. The
leader of the gang, one Pablo Mendes,
came to my house yesterday, and finding
him in the library with Mrs. Fair
I killed him.”</p>

<p>“Proceed,” said Marshall when Fair
paused to note the effect of his announcement,
speaking with so much
coolness that Fair jumped up and went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[Pg 494]</span>
on fiercely: “I tell you, I shot him
down like a dog—murdered him in cold
blood. The servants heard the report
of the pistol. Travers came in a moment
after the shooting and saw the
pistol still warm. I hid the man’s body
in a chest in the library, from which it
was taken by somebody today—so any
effort on my part to delay the hand
of justice would be ridiculous. What
shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!” exclaimed Marshall.
Then he added, as if regretting the unguarded
word: “That is, I can’t advise
you until I know more. Go on.”</p>

<p>“That’s the game, Marshall,” put in
Allyne, pleased by the lawyer’s manifest
incredulity. “Fair, you idiot, do
you fancy that everybody has gone off
his head just because you have?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, Mr. Allyne,” said Marshall
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“You take this rather coolly, I must
say, Marshall,” remarked Fair when
Travers had succeeded in pushing
Allyne into a chair.</p>

<p>“I find coolness conducive to clear
thinking,” replied Marshall.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I have nothing further
to say. I have murdered a man. I
have neither the heart nor the wish to
set up a defense. Were I to clear myself
by technicalities, it would become
the duty of the police to try to establish
the guilt of someone else. Would you
have me sit by quietly, while they drew
the net of skilfully devised circumstantial
evidence around some innocent
person? And to whom else could suspicion
point? My servants—or, God
help her, the woman who is known as
my wife, and who is the noblest soul I
ever met? If you cannot meet my
arguments, I shall go at once to the
police and surrender myself.”</p>

<p>“There will be plenty of time for all
that,” replied Marshall, showing so
little feeling that Allyne was on the
point of breaking out again. “The police
would not believe your story, I fear.
You see, my dear fellow, your case is by
no means unique. Only a very little
while ago one very much like it was
brought to my attention. A murder—or
at all events, a death, had occurred.
Suspicion pointed strongly to one of
two persons—a gentleman of eccentric
character, and the woman whom he
had loved in early youth. Now mark
the dramatic interest. Each of them
confessed the crime to save the other,
but, of course, as they both could not
have been guilty, the court refused to
entertain the charge against either.
There was no evidence except the bogus
confession of the two. I mention
this case only to show you that too
hasty action on your part now may
spoil everything—and you may not be
allowed the luxury of hanging.”</p>

<p>“But, Marshall,” said Fair, “the
cases are not even remotely similar.
Others will testify that I had the most
powerful motives for my crime, and,
unless I should be dastard enough to
lie, nobody else can be suspected. Lopez
knows that Mendes was my enemy.
Janet knows that I was in the room
when the murder was done. Travers
knows that a pistol, which he identified
as mine, had been discharged a few
minutes before he saw me—at the very
time that the servants heard the report
in the library. Moreover, somebody
discovered the body of my victim
where I had hid it. On top of all this
I confess the awful fact. What more
can the law possibly require? You believe
what I tell you, do you not?”</p>

<p>“Not one word of it!” fairly cried
Marshall.</p>

<p>“Marshall,” Fair replied with terrible
earnestness, “you say you doubt my
word. Such a statement must be explained.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” returned Marshall, now
thoroughly in control of his feelings.
“I will explain. I doubt your story
because of its inherent improbability.
Further, I doubt it because I knew
your father, because I know yourself,
and am aware that not even a shameful
death on the gibbet could deter you
from any purpose which you had come
to think your destiny. Again, I doubt
it because I know who the real murderer
of Mendes is.”</p>

<p>The three men who heard these last
slow, calm words sprang to their feet
together, Fair quivering with a nameless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[Pg 495]</span>
horror, and his two friends delirious
with joy.</p>

<p>Fair steadied himself against the
lawyer’s table and said: “Marshall, this
is not the time when you can play with
me. I tell you to your face, that when
you say that you know who the murderer
is, you lie.”</p>

<p>The old man showed how deeply the
insult cut into him, and facing the
young man with his own face as white
as Fair’s, he retorted: “Your father’s
son can go very far with me, but no
man can give me the lie. Recall that
word, Fair.”</p>

<p>Travers looked imploringly at Fair as
he replied.</p>

<p>“I do recall it—and beg your pardon,”
said Fair eagerly. “I also demand
an explanation of your singular
conduct.”</p>

<p>“If you will all sit down,” replied the
solicitor, “I will prove that I am right.
But before I do so I want to say that
in all my life I never heard of such
sublime devotion, such utterly disinterested
heroism. Gentlemen, nothing
will ever be more of an honor to us than
to be called the friends of Maxwell
Fair.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” shouted Allyne, but
Travers said quietly to Marshall: “I
fear this is scarcely kind of you just
now—look at his face.”</p>

<p>The old lawyer looked at Fair, and
going over to him grasped his hand.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, boy,” he said, “but I
meant each word. To end this dreadful
business I have merely to state that
the unhappy creature who sent the
scoundrel to his doom came here not an
hour ago and made a full confession.”</p>

<p>“And on my honor I swear that every
word she said was false,” said Fair.</p>

<p>“You, at least, believe me?” asked
Marshall, turning to Travers.</p>

<p>“Most assuredly,” replied Travers.</p>

<p>Fair wheeled round at him, saying:
“My God, are you men English gentlemen
and going to allow an innocent
woman to be hanged in order to save
me?”</p>

<p>“I seem to hear your father speak in
you,” remarked Marshall, “yet there
is this difference, Fair. He would have
died for a great purpose, but never for
a lie or to defeat the ends of justice.”</p>

<p>Fair winced at this, and Travers
said: “That’s the line, Marshall.”</p>

<p>“Not a word he has said can move
me,” went on Fair, rising. “I want
no man’s forced friendship. I have
decided on a course. You choose to
allow me to pursue it alone. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>He spoke with such feeling, and
moved toward the door with so much
majesty, that none of them attempted
to stop him.</p>

<p>Before he reached the door it was
opened and a closely cropped head appeared,
and a soft, insinuating cockney
voice said: “Beg pardon, I’m sure.
Ferret, gentlemen; Ferret, of Scotland
Yard.”</p>

<p>“You see, Marshall, others are not
as incredulous as you. I am the man
you want, Mr. Ferret,” said Fair as the
detective came in and sat down.</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to you, sir, in a minute,”
replied Ferret jauntily. “Perhaps
these gentlemen will try a cigar in the
gardens for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind them,” quickly returned
Fair; “they know all. Proceed.”</p>

<p>“But you see, sir, they <i>don’t</i> know
all,” replied Ferret.</p>

<p>“I think, Fair, that we would better
let this man speak to you alone,” said
Marshall, rising.</p>

<p>Ferret interposed: “I shall ask you
to stop, if you don’t mind, Mr. Marshall.”</p>

<p>“As you like,” answered Marshall.</p>

<p>Travers and Allyne went downstairs
after shaking Fair’s hand with very
much mixed feelings.</p>

<p>Marshall and Fair turned to Ferret
when the door was closed, and Fair said
sternly: “I see that you have been
rather impudently examining that
sworn statement on the table there.
It will save time if I tell you that it
is false. The lady wrote it under a
nervous strain. It is totally false.”</p>

<p>“Sure. It’s just as false as your
own statement, Mr. Fair,” replied
Ferret, winking knowingly at the solicitor,
who failed to appreciate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[Pg 496]</span>
fellow’s humor and resented his apparently
unconscionable impertinence.</p>

<p>“What the devil do you mean?”
asked Marshall angrily, yet with relief.</p>

<p>“I mean,” answered the cool one,
“that, thanks to my little chum, it now
becomes my painful duty to admit that
I suspected Mr. Fair until about two
hours ago. I now know that Mrs.
Fair’s statement is false—and likewise
Mr. Fair’s also. It’s the other gent’s
statement that is the true one.”</p>

<p>“The other gentleman’s statement?”
asked Fair fiercely. “Why, man, there
was no other man in the room when
the shot was fired.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, come now, Mr. Fair,”
smilingly protested Ferret. “The gent
as fired the shot was there, you know.
You see, Mr. Marshall, it was this way.
Mendes had threatened Mrs. Fair, and
she went out and got the pistol, and at
that moment Mr. Fair came into the
room. Mendes shot himself, and Mr.
Fair, hearing the shot and seeing the
smoking pistol in Mrs. Fair’s hand,
snatched it away from her and declared
that it was he and not her that did the
killing. She came here tonight and
swore it was her, and now he comes and
swears it was him. But Mendes swore
just as he was dying that it was himself—and
the priest will testify to that.”</p>

<p>“But, my heavens, man, Mendes died
at once. I hid his body in——”</p>

<p>“In the chest,” interrupted the detective,
grinning. “Yes, I know all
about that. But, you see, Mendes did
not die. He came to while you were at
dinner. Our fellows followed him to
his lodgings in Soho—and today my
chum got hold of a letter that gave her
the address, and she and I were with
him when he died an hour ago—yes,
and Mrs. Fair is there now.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking Fair sank
back into his chair, as if unconscious
of what was passing, but when Ferret
paused he sprang up, crying, “Marshall,
did you ever hear of anything so
unspeakably glorious as Janet’s devotion?”</p>

<p>“Yes—once,” answered Marshall,
with streaming eyes. “Your own,
Fair.”</p>

<p>“But, Ferret,” went on Fair, when
he had recovered his voice, “who is the
chum who so materially assisted you?
And where is Mrs. Fair now?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fair is by Mendes’s bedside.
My chum is——”</p>

<p>The door opened and Kate Mettleby
came hurrying in, breathless and worn.
Ferret finished by saying: “My chum,
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Fair,” began Kate, after
Fair had presented Marshall to her with
a word of explanation, “have you
heard? Janet is with him—with
Señor Mendes—it was awful—it was
unbearably touching.”</p>

<p>“He is the father of her children,
Kate,” said Fair gently, when Marshall
and Ferret quietly stole out, leaving
them together.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know—and—Maxwell—there
is something—oh, how can I tell
you? She came in and knelt by his
bed with his head in her arms when the
priest told her that he was dead. She
knelt there half an hour, and when it
was time for us to start to come here to
meet you—Maxwell, can you bear it?—when
I went and touched her shoulder
and told her to come away—she—was
dead.”</p>

<p>Kate’s head fell upon her folded
arms on the table and her body shook
with the strain of the awful day’s
events. Fair suffered her to cry herself
into a quieter state. Then he
stooped and laying his hand on her
head, he said: “Kate, the children
have no mother now.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Educational Department</h2></div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE are thousands of boys and girls, some in the schools and colleges, some not,
who are anxious to learn to develop themselves and <span class="smcap">rise</span>. Many, many things they
yearn to know which the class-room teachers do not teach. Many a subject they
are eager to study, if somebody will but show the way. Often there are speeches
to be made, essays to be written, debates to be prepared, and the boys and girls simply
do not know how to start about it. For instance, they are suddenly required to write or
speak on the question: “Should the Government own and operate the railroads?”</p>

<p>They have never read anything about it, perhaps. Therefore they inquire: “Where
can we get some literature on the subject?” These young people do not want someone
else to write their speeches or essays; they want nothing more than to be told where to
get the materials to work with—the data upon which to construct their own argument.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I felt the need of that kind of help very keenly. How was I to
know what books contained the information sought? Who could tell me? I soon found
that teachers did not love to be bored by inquiries of that character, and therefore I had
to browse around in the library at random for what was wanted. If the book needed was
there, I generally found it, after wasting much time in the search. If it was not there, as
frequently happened, I was at my row’s end. I had to debate without the full preparation
which should have been made.</p>

<p>To help out many a student who may be troubled as I used to be, I am going to improvise
and conduct in this Magazine a modest little Educational Department. Primarily
it is meant for the young people. But the rule will be made as flexible as I feel like making
it. Age limits are not fair—no matter whether Osler was joking or not. It is not my
plan or purpose to write anybody’s speech or essay; but, where there is a subject of real
importance to be discussed by word or pen, I am willing to direct the preparation of the
student by telling him or her where the necessary information can be had. It would,
perhaps, not be improper for me to suggest some general ideas on the subject to be discussed—these
ideas to be worked out and put in form by the student. Often I may render
good service to the boys and girls by telling them where the books they need can be bought
at the lowest price. It took me many years to learn how to buy books, and it is a thing
worth knowing—unless you have more money than I ever had.</p>

<p>The letters written to me in this department will be published as written; but the
names of the writers will be withheld. Therefore, no correspondent need be embarrassed
in making inquiries. My replies will be given in the Magazine.</p>

<p>Hereafter all letters asking for information—historical, literary, political, economic—will
be answered through the <span class="smcap">Educational Department</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Would you kindly contribute
to your magazine an article something like
this:</p>

<p>“Should a young man enter politics?”</p>

<p>I have always had a strong desire to enter
politics, and have thought the matter over
a long time, but have as yet failed to reach
a conclusion. If you can do me the very
great favor to advise me on this line you
may feel assured of my hearty appreciation.</p>

<p class="center">Faithfully your friend,</p>

<p class="right">C—— W——.</p>

</div>

<p>It all depends on the motive. A
young man who feels the inclination
to enter politics for the purpose of
contributing his share to honest administration
should, by all means,
do so.</p>

<p>Government does not take care of
itself any more than a cotton crop
does. Both require cultivation, management,
head-work and hand-work.</p>

<p>We can never have good government
unless good men become interested
in politics. Perhaps there
is not a nobler calling known to man
than that of working for the public
welfare in matters governmental—and
this is politics.</p>

<p>A high-minded, warm-hearted philanthropist,
like Mr. J. G. Phelps-Stokes,
of New York, acts admirably
when he ministers to the poor in the
slums; but his work is still more effective
when he gives his thought and
his work to the removal of those
abuses of government which produce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[Pg 498]</span>
the greater part of the miseries of
those slums.</p>

<p>The grandest task which human
intellect can set for itself today is
the redemption of the government
from the usurpers who have used
the machinery of government to enrich
themselves and to plunder their
less fortunate brothers.</p>

<p>It is true that Henry Clay advised
his sons, “Be dogs rather than politicians,”
but this exclamation was
made when Mr. Clay was in a fury of
disappointment because he could not
get to be President.</p>

<p>It is true that John C. Calhoun and
Daniel Webster died broken and disappointed
men, but Mr. Webster had
also set his heart upon being President,
and Mr. Calhoun had devoted himself
to an impossible program.</p>

<p>If a young man enters politics for
the mere sake of getting office or personal
advancement, his motives are
sordid, and his life will be worth
nothing to his fellow-man and nothing
creditable to himself; but, if in conjunction
with honorable ambition,
he entertains the earnest desire to be
useful to the community in which he
lives by exercising his energies in
political work, there is a glorious
field for him.</p>

<p>If this combination of motives inspires
you, my young friend, by all
means yield to your inclination and
“enter politics.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>Mr. Thomas Watson, 121 West Forty-second Street, New York City.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Being in the midst of preparations
for a scholastic debate to be held here
on the —th, kindly permit me to ask your
views on the following: Our question is,
“<i>Resolved</i>, that the Government should
own and control all the railway lines.”</p>

<p>What, in your opinion, are the strongest
arguments to sustain the affirmative side of
this question?</p>

<p>Thanking you for this favor, I remain,</p>

<p class="center">Very respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">E——.</p>

</div>

<p>The strongest arguments in favor
of government ownership of railroads
are:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> Under modern conditions,
the railroads are simply the public
highways over which freight and passengers
must pass, and public highways
should never be owned by private
citizens.</p>

<p>If freight and passengers go by
water route, they must use navigable
rivers, bays, gulfs, oceans. These
public waterways belong to the public,
and all men admit that they should.</p>

<p>Under modern conditions, freight
and passengers are compelled to go by
rail. We have to use the railroads
whether we want to or not. In
traveling any distance, it is no longer
possible for the public to transact
business by the use of the dirt roads,
consequently the transportation lines
are public in their nature and their
uses, and should belong to the public.</p>

<p>They were not built by private
capital, as a rule. In almost every
case the railroads were paid for by
public and private donations, and the
charters granted represented simply
a license issued for a public purpose;
and of course that license can be revoked
at any time, just compensation
for vested interests first having
been paid.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> As now operated, the railroads
are ruinously oppressive in their
charges. Enormous sums of money
are being wrung from the people to pay
dividends on watered stock—a fictitious
value which has no existence except
in ink on paper.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> Under the present system,
the railroads have co-operated with
excessive tariff rates in building up the
trust, which publicly says to the
people: “Pay my price for food, or
starve”; “Pay my price for tools to
work with, or let your fields become
deserts.”</p>

<p>By the secret rebate, by discriminations
of one kind or another, the independent
operator has been driven
out of the field everywhere and the
tyranny of the trusts established.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> It would remove the greater
part of the corruption which is the
bane of our politics.</p>

<p>Railroad corporations maintain their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[Pg 499]</span>
lobbyists at the capital of the nation
and at the capital of every state. They
corrupt representatives, judges, aldermen,
editors, politicians.</p>

<p>They finance national and local
campaigns; their filthy finger-prints
are to be found on almost every page
of our public record.</p>

<p>The only possible way to get rid of
this is to remove the motive. Put
the railroads where the Post-Office
Department is, and there will be no
more motive for rebates, discriminations
and wholesale bribery than there
is in the operation of the Post-Office
Department.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> Government ownership would
make the service uniform, simplify it
in every way and save vast sums by the
consolidation of all the various lines
into one great national system.</p>

<p>It would not need so many high-priced
presidents, high-priced lawyers
and high-priced lobbyists.</p>

<p>One very intelligent writer upon this
subject, C. Wood Davis, figures out a
saving of $160,000,000 on this item by
consolidation.</p>

<p>Government ownership would abolish
deadheadism.</p>

<p>Under our present system, the men
who are most able to pay their way on
the railroad ride free. The man who
is least able to pay, not only has to pay
for himself, but in the long run has to
pay also for the deadheads who ride
free. This will become obvious to anybody
who will think about it for a
moment.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> It would take away the power
of the railroads to destroy any individual,
any business or any community.
It would save the thousands
of lives which are now lost every year
for lack of double tracks, safety appliances
and reasonable hours of labor.</p>

<p>It would enable the cotton grower
of the South to exchange his products
with the corn grower of the West in
such a way that the railroad would not
get more for hauling the corn than the
man who raised it got for it when he
sold it.</p>

<p>At present the Southern farmer
pays seventy-five and eighty cents per
bushel, cash, for corn which the farmer
of the West sold for thirty-five cents.
The transportation companies get the
lion’s share of that enormous difference.</p>

<p>It would put an end to strikes, and
would put into the hands of the people
a weapon with which they could destroy
any combine among capitalists
in any article of commerce.</p>

<p>Among other things, it would save
the tremendous sum of $65,000,000
which the Federal Government now
pays to the railroads every year for the
carriage of the mails, and that saving
could be applied to extending the
Rural Free Delivery to the remotest
parts of the country.</p>

<p>If the Government owned the railroads
and carried its own mails in
steel cars, the Post-Office Department
would show a profit instead of a loss,
and railway mail clerks would be
able to insure their lives. At present
they cannot insure their lives, for the
reason that the Government allows
them to be hauled around in flimsy
dry-goods boxes, whose cost of construction
is less than the annual rent
which our Government pays for their
use and which invariably get smashed to
splinters whenever there is a collision.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Locust Grove, Ga.</span>, April 21, 1905.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: As affirmative debaters on
the subject: “<i>Resolved</i>, That the democratic
principles of the United States are in danger
of being superseded by those of an aristocracy,”
we have secured very valuable
help from your articles in the April number
of <span class="smcap">Tom Watson’s Magazine</span>, and knowing
that you, being a student of political
economy, could give us some personal suggestions,
we would appreciate your sending
us material on the subject at our expense.</p>

<p class="center">Very respectfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">—— ——.</p>

</div>

<p>A Democracy—it being the government
of all by all and for the benefit
of all—cannot continue to be a true
democracy unless the laws conform
to the democratic standard laid down
by Thomas Jefferson—namely, “<i>Equal
and exact justice to all men, without
special favors to any</i>.”</p>

<p>An Aristocracy is a government in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[Pg 500]</span>
which the few make the laws for their
own benefit, and rule the country for
their own good.</p>

<p>Therefore it must be apparent to
the most casual student that if we, by
law, confer special favors upon any
class of our citizens, we are building up
an aristocracy and are departing from
democratic principles.</p>

<p>(1) For instance, the power to create
money and to regulate the volume
thereof is a sovereign power belonging
to the state.</p>

<p>In countries ruled by kings that
power has always been one of the prerogatives
of the crown, as was the
power to make war and peace, to negotiate
treaties and to levy taxes. It
was recognized that the king could not
continue in the full exercise of his
kingly authority if he parted with the
tremendous power of creating money.</p>

<p>Not until the English crown rested
upon the head of the most dissolute of
the Stuarts, Charles II, and he had become
the slave of an abandoned woman—who
was in turn the tool of a
grasping corporation, the East India
Company—was the power to create
money transferred from the king to a
corporation.</p>

<p>Ever since that day Great Britain
has suffered from this surrender of
sovereign power, and it was this mistake
of the king which Alexander Hamilton,
either through mistake or by
design, adopted when he came to
frame a financial system for the
American people.</p>

<p>It was his express purpose to create
an aristocracy of wealth, and he must
have realized that when he took from
the government the power to create
money and put it into the hands of a
private corporation he was creating
an aristocracy of wealth.</p>

<p>The national banks of today represent
an aristocracy of wealth, supported
by the governmental function
of creating currency.</p>

<p>There are, in round numbers, 5,000
national bankers who have in circulation
$400,000,000 of their “promises to
pay,” which the law practically makes
legal tender.</p>

<p>In other words, their <i>“promises to
pay” are used as money</i>.</p>

<p>There are 80,000,000 natural persons
in this country; there are 5,000 corporations
called national banks! The
80,000,000 natural persons may sign
promissory notes for five dollars each,
and these notes are simply commercial
paper, having no circulation as money.
The 5,000 national banks sign their
promissory notes to the same amount—$400,000,000—and
these notes constitute,
for all practical purposes, a national
currency—a national money.</p>

<p><i>The law gives them the special privilege
of getting rich on what they owe.</i> They
have also the more dangerous power
of <i>enlarging and contracting the volume
of currency, thus unsettling values, destroying
markets and producing panics,
as they did in 1893</i>.</p>

<p>(2) The democratic principle of
equal and exact justice to all men
requires that the government should
derive its revenue from a system of taxation
which deals fairly with every citizen.
Each man should contribute to
the support of the government in proportion
to his ability. And taxes
should not be laid for the purpose of
building up one man’s business at the
expense of another’s.</p>

<p>Our tariff system, from which the
government derives the greater part
of its revenue, violates democratic
principles.</p>

<p>Its purpose and result is to build up
manufacturers at the expense of everybody
not engaged in manufacturing.
It gives the manufacturer a price which
he could not get without the law which
insures him the monopoly of the home
market. <i>All the world can compete
with our laborers by sending immigrants
to our shores; all the world can compete
with our farmers; but nobody is allowed
to compete with our manufacturers</i>, <span class="smcap">and
the result is the Trust</span>, under which
Americans combine to rob the helpless
American citizen, who is not allowed
to buy his food or his clothing
or tools to work with from anyone
except the American manufacturer.</p>

<p>By this system, which lays the taxes
on the things which man buys, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[Pg 501]</span>
citizen who is worth only a few hundred
or a few thousand dollars pays
just as much to the support of the
Federal Government as is paid by the
man who is worth tens of millions of
dollars.</p>

<p>Consequently the inevitable tendency
of the tariff system is to create
a class which controls the government
for its own enrichment; <i>in other words,
an aristocracy</i>.</p>

<p>(3) Consider our corporation laws.
Early in the history of our Government
Chief Justice John Marshall decided
that a charter granted to a corporation
was a contract and could not
be changed by the sovereign power of
the state. This decision was not good
law, and no good lawyer has ever considered
it so. John Marshall had a
great mind, but he was one of the rankest
partisans that ever lived. He
stretched every constitutional power in
the effort to build up what Hamilton
wanted—an aristocracy of wealth.</p>

<p><i>Just as a natural person is born into
a community and lives in it subject to
having his status changed by the will of
the majority, expressed in a legal way,
so a corporation, born into a community
through its charter, should have been required
to take the same chance of having
its status changed, in a legal way, by
the will of the majority.</i></p>

<p>A railroad corporation comes to the
legislature and procures a charter to
build a railroad; <i>but the state cannot
compel the corporation to build that railroad.</i>
In other words, the state cannot
compel the execution of the powers
granted under the charter; therefore
<i>such a charter lacks the very first element
of a contract, because a contract is one
in which each party can be compelled
to perform his part or pay consequent
damages</i>. But, in pursuance of the
decision of John Marshall in the Dartmouth
College case, our state and national
governments have erected a rule
of the corporations, and they are now
more powerful than the governments
which created them.</p>

<p>The great transportation companies
exercise the power to tax, and the
people, who pay the taxes, have no
representation in the councils of those
who levy the taxes. This surely constitutes
an aristocracy of the most powerful
kind.</p>

<p>The railroads have the power to tax
the life out of any industry, out of any
section, out of any city or town; <i>with
rebates and discriminations they build
up the Trusts which plunder the people</i>.</p>

<p>By reason of the fact that they enjoy
the privilege of taxing other people,
<i>they pay no Federal taxes to support the
government</i>. Whatever they may pay
in the way of tariff on material which
they use in the construction of roadbeds
and rolling stock, they simply
charge up to expense account and levy
their rates so as to make the utmost
possible profit over and above what
they have paid out. The public cannot
escape the freight rates and the
passenger rates which the corporations
levy. The public cannot help itself.
The public is made to pay, in those
freight and passenger rates, every dollar
of tax which the railroads have
paid to the state and Federal governments.
Therefore, as in the case of
the national banks and the manufacturers,
we have a great class of corporations
given special powers by law
which are exercised at the expense of
the masses of the people, and which
escape all the burden of supporting the
national Government by reason of the
immunities and privileges which the
law has made for their exclusive benefit.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a complete illustration
of aristocracy—the government
of the few, by the few and for the
few, instead of the ideal of Jefferson
and Lincoln, “government of the
people, by the people and for the
people.”</p>

<p class="center">TRACK WALKER KILLED</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Westfield, N. J.</span>, April 14.—John Long,
a New Jersey Central track walker, was
killed by a train today.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF you have nothing else to do
some day when you are passing
through the vast network of
tracks of, for example, the great railway
running northward out of New
York, give a thought to the man who
walks them for you, the man on whom
your safety, in this particular place,
so much depends.</p>

<p>He is a peculiar individual. His
work is so very exceptional, so very
different from your own. While you
are sitting in your seat placidly wondering
whether you are going to have
a pleasant evening at the theatre or
whether the business to which you are
about to attend will be as profitable
as you desire, he is out on the long
track over which you are speeding,
calmly examining the bolts that hold
the shining metals together. Neither
rain nor sleet can deter him. The presence
of intense heat or intense cold has
no effect on his labors. Day after day,
at all hours and in all sorts of weather,
he may be seen placidly plodding these
iron highways, his wrench and sledge
crossed over his shoulders, his eyes riveted
on the rails, carefully watching to
see whether any bolts are loose or any
spikes sprung. Upward of two hundred
cannon-ball flyers rush by him
on what might be called a four-track
bowling alley each day, and yet he
dodges them all for perhaps as little
as any laborer is paid. If he were not
watchful, if he did not perform his work
carefully and well, if he had a touch
of malice or a feeling of vengefulness,
he could wreck your train, mangle your
body and send you praying and screaming
to your Maker. There would be
no sure way of detecting him.</p>

<p>Death lurks in this tunnel. Here,
if anywhere, it may be said to be constantly
watching. What with the noise,
which is a perfect and continuous uproar,
the smoke, which hangs like a
thick, gloomy pall over everything, and
the weak, ineffective lights which shine
out on your near approach like will-o’-the-wisps,
the chances of hearing and
seeing the approach of any particular
train are small. Side arches, or small
pockets in the walls, are provided for
the protection of the men, but these
are not always to be reached in time
when a train thunders out of the gloom.
If you look sharp you may sometimes
see a figure crouching in one of these
as you scurry past. He is so close to
the grinding wheels that the dust and
soot of them are flung into his very
soul.</p>

<p>And yet for all this the money that
is paid these men is beggarly small.
The work that they do is not considered
exceptionally valuable. Fifteen
cents an hour is all that they are paid,
and this for ten to twelve hours’ work
every day. That their lives are in constant
danger is not of any point in the
matter. They are supposed to work
willingly for this, and they do. Only
when one is picked off and his body
mangled by a passing train is the grimness
of the sacrifice emphasized, and
then only for a moment. The space
which such accident gets in the public
prints is scarcely more than a line.</p>

<p>And now what would you say of
men who would do this work for fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[Pg 503]</span>
cents an hour? What estimate
would you put on their mental capacity?
Would you say that they are
only worth what they can be made to
work for? One of these men, an intelligent
type of laborer, not a drinker,
and one who did not even smoke, attracted
the writer’s attention by the
punctuality with which he crossed a
given spot on his beat. He was a
middle-aged man, married, and had
three children. Day after day, week
after week, he used to arrive at this
particular spot, his eye alert, his step
quick, and when a train approached
he seemed to become aware of it as if
by instinct. When finally asked by
the writer why he did not get something
better to do he said, “I have no
trade. Where could I get more?”</p>

<p>This man was killed by a train. Sure
as was his instinct and keen his eye, he
was nevertheless caught one evening,
and at the very place where he deemed
himself most sure. His head was completely
obliterated, and he had to be
identified by his clothes. When he was
removed another eager applicant was
given his place, and now he is walking
in the tunnel with a half-dozen others.
If you question these men they will all
tell you the same story. They do not
want to do what they are doing, but
it is better than nothing.</p>

<h3>“A FREE BREAKFAST TABLE”</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE recent suggestion of a tariff tax
on coffee, probably put out as a
feeler, is responsible for the resurrection
and reintroduction of the
once familiar but never appropriate phrase
at the head of this article. It was never
appropriate; it was always a sarcastic sneer,
rather than a statement of fact, because the
memory of the most aged citizen runneth
not to the time when “a free breakfast
table,” a breakfast table untaxed as to itself,
its equipment and the food and drink it
bore, could be found in any American home.
At this time, under the tariff of 1897, what
could be more preposterously absurd than
the notion that a tax on coffee would be a
decree of banishment for that alleged boon?</p>

<p>The <i>Post</i>, being an advocate and defender
of the policy of protection, although
a condemner and contemner of the outrages
incident to the stand-pat policy, is in no
hurry to witness the advent of “a free
breakfast table”; but the <i>Post</i> prefers that
such a crass absurdity, such a stinging
satire as this old shibboleth, should be returned
forthwith to the dust and darkness
from which it was dragged when the coffee
tax proposition appeared.</p>

<p>The truth is, you go to breakfast clad in
taxed garments, wearing no single article
that is not taxed in the tariff; you sit in a
chair that is taxed as to all the various
materials that enter into it, and taxed as a
whole; the table itself is similarly taxed,
and we can think of no article on it that is
free. Your tablecloth, your napkins and
your napkin rings are all in the tariff
schedules. Your fish or meat, your vegetables
and fruit, your bread, your butter,
your rolls, your griddle cakes, your sugar
and syrup, your salt, vinegar, pepper,
mustard, olive oil and all other condiments
show up in the list of things taxed. So is
it with your china or other crockery, and
your knives, forks and spoons.</p>

<p>And your coffee is free only as to the raw
bean. It is roasted over a taxed fire and in
a taxed roaster, is stored in taxed receptacles
and transported by taxed horses in taxed
wagons; when retailed, it goes out in taxed
bags, to be deposited in other taxed vessels.
Having been ground in a taxed mill, your
cook prepares it for the table by using a
taxed coffee pot. If you use cream in your
“free” coffee you must use taxed cream;
if you use sugar in it you must use taxed
sugar.</p>

<p>This is the “free breakfast table” whose
exit will come if a duty is imposed on the
raw coffee bean!—<i>Washington Post.</i></p>

<h3>FAR-SIGHTED CARLOS MORALES</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> United States is now in Santo Domingo;
President Roosevelt, with a stroke
of the pen, has fixed Don Carlos Morales
firmly in the saddle. That cheerful and
ingenious bandit begins to enjoy the unearned
increment of the “status quo.” He
can read now with a smile of the erstwhile
terrible preparations of Jiminez and Barba.
He can sit in his palace and rake in 45 per
cent. of the customs revenues of his republic,
collected for him and scrupulously accounted
for. That was what Morales wanted, and
he is happy. Domestic malice, foreign levy—nothing
can touch him further.</p>

<p>If Cipriano Castro had one-tenth of the
ingenuity of his brother bandit of the black
republic he would have seen long ago that
his present policy is foolish. Instead of
making faces at the United States, Castro
should have been busy inducing the foreigners
in his country to set up a concurrent
roar. He should have acknowledged the
validity of claims of any kind and to any
amount, the bigger the better. Then, at
the psychological moment, he should have
pointed to the imminent danger to the
Monroe Doctrine, and begged the United
States to enter and preserve order, collect
his revenues and pay him a share of the
proceeds.</p>

<p>If there is any other Central or South
American dictator who is shaky on his pins,
now is the time he should apply for relief.
Let him take a lesson from Morales and
imitate that “prudent and far-seeing statesman.”
Forty-five per cent. of the revenues,
in clean, hard coin, without work or
worry, is better than all the revenues with
danger of revolution and dismemberment.</p>

<p>Step up, gentlemen! The United States
has a big navy, and it has nothing to do at
home. Our duty is to protect our weak
and struggling sister republics, and now
that the Senate is out of the way, we propose
to do it. We shall take right hold,
and leave to the future the problem of how
to let go.—<i>Washington Post.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A good</span> sign of awakening conscience is
evident by the protest from the ministers
against accepting Rockefeller’s money that
has been wrested from the people by indirection.
The great success of the Standard
Oil robberies has spawned upon the
country hundreds of such corporations that
plunder the public with even more skill than
the Standard. If the church accepts this
donation it will be as fatal to it as the thirty
pieces of silver were to Judas. This protest
against the gift by these ministers is a most
courageous act. The Standard Oil tactics
may lose every one of them their pulpits.
The Standard Oil management will stoop to
any kind of dirty work to perpetuate the
system. They are attempting now to ruin
Lawson, and, with all his astuteness and his
millions of wealth to back him, they may
succeed in doing so. The people should
stand by Lawson to a man, and the congregations
of these ministers that have
dared to affront Rockefeller should see that
none of his poisoned arrows reach them.—<i>The

<h3>CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> hear much of Christian Civilization,
but we do not see so much of it. Let us
consider briefly the Christian world:</p>

<p>Russia—Anarchy, rapine, bloodshed,
pauperism and starvation.</p>

<p>Austro-Hungary—Disease, strife, strikes,
poverty and pauperism of millions.</p>

<p>Italy—Overpopulation, dire poverty,
with millions of the people actual beggars,
excessive taxation and a practically bankrupt
treasury.</p>

<p>England—Army of unemployed, a vast
section of the population in a poverty so
appalling that it makes one’s heart bleed to
read the details.</p>

<p>Ireland—Practically a nation of paupers,
not of their own volition either, but as a result
of evil laws and customs which have
destroyed the hopes of a gallant people.</p>

<p>Spain—Once the proud leader of nations,
reduced to the rags and sores of Lazarus.</p>

<p>United States—In the grasp of graft, the
people being robbed of their earnings at
every turn by a lot of as conscienceless
pirates as ever scuttled a ship, and a government
apparently impotent.</p>

<p>Everywhere we find more or less the same
evil conditions.</p>

<p>Our President says it is very wicked for
the mail-carriers to organize and have a
man lobby for them; still worse to organize

their efforts to get better wages and
conditions of employment. Why don’t the
President call a halt on the corporation
lobby (some of them having known offices
in Washington with as many as ten clerks)
who defeat men and measures. Let this be
denied, but we do know that corporations
fix nominating conventions where nominations
are equivalent to election; especially
naming those who say: “I am in the hands
of my friends.”—<i>Ohio Liberty Bell.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Government issues money and loans

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> slave-owners of today do not realize
that they own slaves. And the slaves do
not realize that they have owners. Formerly
one man owned one, a dozen or a
hundred slaves. Occasionally even more
than that. Now a hundred thousand men
each own a part of every slave. The great
mass of the people are slaves to unjust systems,
and everyone who profits by these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[Pg 506]</span>
systems is part owner of everyone who loses
by them. If there could be a partition suit
and every slave owner be set apart his
share, the fact that there are slaves today,
and millions of them, would be quite plain.
It would be found that this man owns fifty
slaves, that man a hundred and some as
high as fifty thousand. Should the richest
girl in the United States be given white
girls only as her share of the slaves, she
would have a thousand at least—a thousand
white girl slaves. Some persons are
part slave and part free, because they get a
little more than the commonest kind of a
living. Sixty million people in the United
States are either all or part slave, and the
number who are all slave is much greater
than that of the black population in the
days of chattel slavery. This new slavery
exists because the owners do not realize
that they are owners and the slaves do not
realize that they are slaves. Years ago

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1896 Mr. Bryan had undisputed control

defeated.</p>

<p>In 1900 he still had control, and was defeated
worse than before.</p>

<p>Now, let it be remembered that all the
Western Populists, with their newspaper
press—including such strong and widely
circulated papers as the Nebraska <i>Independent</i>,
supported him; and let it be further
understood that now and in the future
he will get no support from Populists or the
Populist press; then figure out the lurid

country in 1908.</p>

<p>Now, with this actual state of things confronting
him, does anyone believe that Mr.
Bryan has any hope of reorganizing the
shattered ranks and disgraced leaders of the
Democracy into a winning party in 1908?</p>

<p>And, if he has no such hope—and in reason
he cannot have—what is his purpose

Steel and Wire Company. It was only a
case of “another Hungarian killed in the
mills,” as the Coroner expressed it, but
Adelbert Merle, the Austro-Hungarian Consul-General
in this city, backed by the
Coroner, will appeal to the state, and, if
necessary, to the Federal authorities, to do
something to protect these men.</p>

<p>“During the first month of my term,”
said Coroner Armstrong, “one plant alone,
the Duquesne plant of the United States
Steel Corporation, had twelve separate
fatalities. That was the number reported
to this office. How many more there were
no one may ever know. I went to the officials
of the corporation and entered a complaint.
Then an order was issued that more care
would have to be taken, and next month
not a death was reported from the Duquesne
plant.”</p>

<p>Said Consul-General Merle:</p>

<p>“A very large number of the Hungarians
employed in the mills are American citizens,
and some consideration should be given
them on that account, if not on the score of
humanity. It is proposed to organize the
Hungarians and other foreigners who are
voters and see if some action cannot be
secured in the legislature to compel the
mill owners to give better protection to the
workmen.”</p>

<p>“The number of fatalities which occur in
the steel mills, the blast furnaces and the
coal mines in the Pittsburg district are
never fully reported,” said an attaché of
the consulate. “Scarcely a month goes by
that we are not called upon to investigate the
case of some workman who is reported to us
as having ‘disappeared.’ At present we are
working on two such cases. Both are
identical as regards details.</p>

<p>“The men were stationed at the top of
blast furnaces owned by the United States
Steel Corporation to receive the cars of ore
as they came up and dump them. There is
only a small bridge for them to stand on.
One misstep or awkward movement, and
the man will follow the ore into the furnace.
The men are not missed until it is noticed
that the cars are not being dumped. No
one knows what has become of them.
Their coats and dinner pails await them at
the bottom of the elevator, but the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[Pg 507]</span>
never come to claim them. Then they are
reported to have ‘disappeared.’ It is not
known positively that they have fallen into
the furnace, but there can be no other conclusion.”</p>

<p>The officials of the steel mills say they
will do anything in their power to conduce
to the safety of the men, and that the foremen
in charge are mainly responsible for
any dereliction.—<i>New York World.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> a man should loan money at one-half
of 1 per cent., and borrow it back at 8 per
cent., and keep this up year after year, his
family would have no trouble in getting
him put under guardianship. The people
through their Government are acting just
as foolishly when they issue money to
national banks....</p>

<p>A billion and a half of taxes. Another
billion and a half of railroad charges. And
a billion of interest, not counting the interest
on public and railroad debts. A

<h3>LESE-MAJESTE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Because</span> a passing steamer did not regard
it necessary to give a tow to the <i>Sylph</i>
the other day some of the frenzied Republican
newspapers of the North seem to
think there will be trouble with the skipper
of the afore-mentioned steamer when T.
Roosevelt gets back to civilization.</p>

<p>For the <i>Sylph</i>, they claim, is the President’s
yacht, and certainly there must be
punishment, prompt and dire, for any rover
of the high seas who dares show lack of deep
concern over her.</p>

<p>Lèse-majesté with a vengeance!</p>

<p>Of course, it does not occur to the frenzied
Republican press that the <i>Sylph</i> is not the
President’s yacht; that she is a vessel of the
navy, kept in commission at public expense,
and should be used only for public purposes;
and that the President has no possible warrant
in law for keeping her at Washington
or taking her out to sea for the personal
pleasure of himself or the members of his
family.</p>

<p>If the <i>Sylph</i> is not needed in the active
service of the country she ought to be taken
out of commission; if she is needed by the
navy she should be so used. In either event
she is not the President’s yacht, nor should
she be utilized as such at public expense.—<i>Atlanta

<h3>AUTOMOBILE MANSLAUGHTER</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> one week of the new season five
persons have been killed by automobiles in
this city, not counting the young man who
fell from the “Seeing New York” omnibus.
As many more have been very seriously
hurt.</p>

<p>The heartlessness of some speed-maddened
votaries has been again illustrated.
There was the woman who in a Brooklyn
street shrieked out: “Go on quickly, Harry;
the man is killed!” There is that young
man of the reckless rich class, whose autos
are debited with two deaths and are a
terror to thousands living, caught again
running at eighteen miles an hour in the
street. That “sports” might scorch to the
Aqueduct races a little girl in Elmhurst
yielded up her young life.</p>

<p>The man who drives his auto at dangerous
speed is as responsible morally for the
death he thereby causes as one would be
who should fire a revolver at random down
the same street and by “accident” kill a
victim.</p>

<p>Manslaughter by automobile will continue
until it is punished as severely as
other manslaughter, and until the certain
penalty of illegal speeding is jail, not for
the driver, but for the owner.—<i>New York

<p class="center">Have You Had My Free Lesson in Jiu-Jitsu?</p>

<p>If you do not already know that Jiu-Jitsu is the most wonderful system of physical training and self-defense
in the world to-day I invite you to write for my <b>FREE LESSON</b> and demonstrate this to your
own satisfaction.</p>

<p class="center">YAE KICHI YABE, Late of the Ten-Shin<br />
Ryu School of Japan.</p>

<p>It is to the persistent practice of Jiu-Jitsu that the Japanese owe their courage and success in battle,
their almost superhuman strength and power of endurance, their low
death rate and their material progress. Surely a system of physical
training which has done so much for the Island Nation will interest you.
Jiu-Jitsu not only embodies the ideal principles of attaining perfect health
and perfect physical development, but as a means of self-defense it is as
potent at short range as the deadliest weapon. A knowledge of its self-preserving
principles renders a man or woman impregnable to every
form of vicious attack.</p>

<p class="center">Jealously Guarded Secrets Revealed.</p>

<p>For over two thousand years the principles of Jiu-Jitsu have been
religiously guarded. By an imperial edict the teaching of the system
was forbidden outside of Japan. The friendly feeling, however, existing
between Japan and the United States has been instrumental in releasing
Jiu-Jitsu from its oath-bound secrecy, and I have been delegated to teach,
without reserve, all the secrets of this ancient art to Americans.</p>

<p>I have just written an intensely interesting book which explains and
makes clear the principles of Jiu-Jitsu in a manner which will never be
approached by any American writer. So long as the edition lasts this
book, together with my first lesson in Jiu-Jitsu, will be sent free to interested
persons. The lesson is fully illustrated and teaches one of the
most effective methods known for disposing of a dangerous antagonist.</p>

<p>If you desire to learn all the closely guarded secrets of this marvelous science send your name and
address, and you will receive the book and specimen lesson by return mail, postage paid.</p>

<li>Well known people—</li>
<li>Living in the coldest sections—</li>
<li>After the severest tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>A recent correspondent, referring to our

a cost of $35 per annum.</i>”</p>

<p>Hundreds of such letters come to us.</p>

Furnace a ton of cheapest grade of coal
is made to produce as much heat as a ton
of the most costly grade; the coal is fed
from below and the fire is on top—the
rational way; the gases and smoke do
not escape up the chimney as they do in
ordinary furnaces, but are consumed as
they pass up through the fire; immunity
from gas, smoke and dirt; less ashes
and no clinkers; simple and strong in

were caused by
DISEASE</p>

<p class="no-indent">physicians would have long ago found
a remedy. Tonics and lotions applied to
the outside of the scalp do soften the
hair—but that’s all. By exercising the
arms, we build up muscle—<i>not</i> by outside
applications of medicine. The arms,
the body and the lower limbs can be exercised
at will—but the <i>scalp</i> requires
mechanical aid. Exercise makes the
blood circulate, lack of exercise makes
it stagnant. The Vacuum method is the
kind of exercise that makes the blood
circulate. It gently draws the rich blood
to the scalp and feeds the shrunken hair
roots. This causes the hair to grow.
It is the simple, common-sense principle
of physical culture applied to the scalp.</p>

<p class="center">EYEGLASSES NOT NECESSARY</p>

<p>Eyesight Can Be Strengthened and
All Forms of Diseased Eyes Cured
Without Cutting or Drugging.</p>

<p>That the eyes can be strengthened so that eyeglasses
can be dispensed with in the great majority of cases has
been proven beyond a doubt by the testimony of thousands
of people who have been cured by that wonderful
little instrument called “Actina.” Actina also cures sore
and granulated lids, Glaucoma, Iritis, &amp;c., also removes
Cataracts and Pterygiums, without cutting or drugging.
Over seventy thousand Actinas have been sold, therefore
it is not an experiment, but an absolute fact. The following
letters are but samples of those that are received daily:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mrs. M. E. Champney, 242 West 135th st.,
New York City, writes:—“The ‘Actina’ cured
me of Iritis, after the doctors said there was no
cure outside an operation. I have been entirely
well for over four months, can see to read and
sew as well as before. I can honestly recommend
‘Actina’ for all afflictions of the eye.”</p>

<p>Emily Knapp, 920 Galina st., Milwaukee,
Wis., writes:—“The ‘Actina’ I purchased from
you a year ago saved my brother’s eyesight.
My brother was near-sighted, wore number five
and six glasses, and now he can go to school and do all his work and study
without glasses.”</p>

</div>

<p>E. R. Holdbrook, Deputy County Clerk, Fairfax, Va., writes:—“‘Actina’
has cured my eyes so that I can do without glasses. I very seldom have
headache now, and can study up to eleven o’clock after a hard day’s work
at the office.”</p>

<p>Actina is not a drug or a lotion, but a small pocket
battery, which can be used by old and young with perfect
safety. It is impossible to do harm with Actina. Every
member of the family can use the one Actina for any form
of disease of the Eye, Ear, Throat or Head. Actina will
last for years, and is always ready for use. Actina will be
sent on trial postpaid.</p>

<p>A charming daylight sail through LONG ISLAND, VINEYARD
and NANTUCKET SOUNDS. Fine view of picturesque NOVA
SCOTIA and of the bold, rugged NEWFOUNDLAND COAST.
A two weeks’ cruise at one-quarter the cost of going to Europe,
and a greater change of air and scene. Steamers sail weekly, making the
trip from New York to St. Johns and return in thirteen days, and there
can be no more delightful ocean voyage for those who want rest and sea
air. The steamers remain in Halifax one day both going and returning
and two days in St. Johns, thus giving passengers an opportunity to visit
these beautiful and interesting cities and surrounding country. The cost
is low and the accommodations and service the very best. (<b>STOP-OVER

Shave with a “<b>GEM</b>” on train

the quickest, easiest, simplest
way. There is but one way to grow
rich—<b>SAVE</b>. Begin by stopping the
“Barber Habit.” You spend 50 cents
to $1.00 per week getting shaved, or
$26.00 to $52.00 each year. Shave yourself,
save the money and the time
which is money. Two minutes suffices
for a shave with the “<b>GEM</b>”—can’t
cut yourself, and no fear of
infection. Highest-grade materials,
finest finish, imported blades—best
English cutlery steel, edged by experts.
Simple, durable, automatic,
and built on scientific principles.
The “<b>GEM</b>” has become the “Standard”

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
